            "[\"It's good for beginners\", 'I recommend this starter Ukulele kit.  I has everything you\\nneed to learn the Ukulele.', \"G'daughter received this for Christmas present last year and plays if often.\", 'According to my order history, I bought this this kit towards the end of 2012 as a Black Friday Week Lightning Deal. I\\'m writing this nearly four years later.\\n\\nAs with any stringed instrument, the strings really needed to stretch out before they would stay in tune. So, for the first several days, it was play a few minutes, tune, play a few minutes, tune. Then it was tuning daily. After a few weeks of this, the uke held a tune great. A tuner is not included in the package, which is the bulk of the minus star because a real beginner wouldn\\'t have a way to tune the thing. (You need either a tuner or a reference note, say, on a piano or keyboard.) You can download a decent tuner app, though, for a buck or so. Do it, because you\\'re going to need it a lot for the first couple of weeks.\\n\\nThe \"Firebrand\" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. It\\'s kind of dead-sounding. But then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it\\'s part of their distinctive character. The finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. But the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. The beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there\\'s nothing to snag or catch. Fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. The action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. The tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they\\'re a definite step up from simple peg tuners. They make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. The bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don\\'t have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.\\n\\nI visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what I paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. They were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. I left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. They\\'re fun!\\n\\nThe bag is lightly made, unpadded, and has a fixed-length strap for carrying. It offered no advantage over just grabbing the uke to carry it, while adding the considerable disadvantage of needing to unpack it to play. It promptly went into the giveaway pile.\\n\\nWe haven\\'t watched the DVDs, because the book has been great. It starts with C7 and F, and then adds C and G7, then G and D7. So it\\'s not the C Am F G combo very common on YouTube. The songs are American folk traditionals, so if you\\'ve been around a campfire where any singing was involved, you\\'ve probably heard them before. There are lots of good instructions available online, including videos, so, really, the book is just a kick-starter to get you going. It\\'s a pretty good book, with a reference section at the back with more chord diagrams than you\\'re likely to need.\\n\\nIn all, it\\'s an acceptable inexpensive starter set, not worth the \"list price\" but an OK value at Amazon\\'s discounted price and a bargain at the Gold Box/Lightning Deal price.\\n\\nUPDATE: I changed the strings to the Aquila Nylgut AQ-4 set. Yeah, they\\'re $10 strings on a $15 instrument, but the improvement in sound is just huge. I also polished the frets and fingerboard with a \"magic eraser\"-like product (an ultra-fine abrasive), shined up the body, and filed down the plastic saddle (which simply pops out of the bridge) to lower the action. It plays and sounds much better now, although the intonation remains sharp on several notes if you go note-for-note up the frets.\\n\\nUPDATE #2: OK, after going through the book I binge-watched the DVD. It consists of two segments of about 33 minutes each, each segment subdivided into easy-to-locate chapters that follow the pages of the book. It\\'s really very good! The \"instructor\" (and remember, I bought this four years ago so this may have changed) was musician Julia Jordan. Production values were good, and the multi-angle views of playing were helpful, as were all the play-along segments. Minor quibbles: Jordan played a larger ukulele than the one in the pack, so you can\\'t hold it in the exact same way. And it seemed like the songs were keyed to a higher register than her natural speaking/singing voice (you can hear her singing her own songs on a special feature and she\\'s very pleasant to listen to).\\n\\nUPDATE #3: I now own a couple better ukuleles, have been a member of a ukulele meetup, and play a little almost every day. I can tell the difference between any of my better ukes and this one by both feel and ear. Still, it\\'s a totally useable instrument, and it got me started on an enjoyable little musical hobby.

This kit got me going, so it was worth the money, even if Amazon hadn\\'t refunded me!\\n\\nI\\'m a woodwind girl, but wanted something to take camping for around the campfire. Ordered this because it was a kit and on price point alone.  For the price paid, this has given me a lifelong hobby and a way to connect with my kids. Huge value.\\n\\nThe bag is pretty useless. It\\'s thin and crinkly with no protective qualities, really. I suppose it would protect from sunlight and dust.  The cd and DVD are good, but I have gotten much more use out of youtube tutorials!  However, having the chords there in the book are nice, and does provide some basic musical notation info.\\n\\nThe instrument is obviously a \"starter\" uke. It\\'s light and the finish isn\\'t beautiful, but it doesn\\'t look like a toy, either. The matte finish does attract fingerprints and is very plain. I bought some rub on transfers to personalize and decorate, which made me happier.  The strings do have to be tuned frequently, but I expected that from the reviews. After three weeks of daily playing they tune easier and stay tuned longer but still need tuning before each session. I bought  the Hola! Electronic tuner and just leave it clipped on. Works beautifully.  I think the sound is pretty and it seems reasonably well made for the price.

The only downside is that it doesn't stay tuned for very long.  We always have to go and re-tune it, which can be frustrating.  But otherwise it seems well made, it looks great and when its tunes, the sound is good.  Its not multi-hundred dollar instrument, but for kids and beginners its a good deal.\", \"My hubby and I decided we wanted to learn to play the uke, so we ordered this set based on decent reviews.  Wonderful.  We learned to play thanks to this kit.  While the instrument itself certainly isn't of high quality, it is more than adequate and has a good sound.  The real jewel in the crown 'tho is the instruction book.  Fab! It is highly informative, easy to follow, and has some good songs in it.  I still use it for reference and do not pick up my uke without that book nearby.\", 'This is a great package for beginners. I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago.  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called \"Easy Ukelele\" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free.  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. I purchase this as gift to my son\\'s 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it. I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.\\n\\nMy Review:\\n\\n1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the \"Easy Ukelele\" app I mentioned above.\\n\\n2. The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent. It has a sticker that says made in china. It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune. It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle. I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string.  It could be that the string included is a cheap one.  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine).  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning. I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range. I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it.\\n\\nSo, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.\\n\\n2. The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string. The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string. The extra string package says \"Gangia Brand\" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.\\n\\n3. The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners. The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.\\n\\n4. The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.\\n\\n5. The DVD\\'s and CD\\'s: I have not tried the DVD and CD\\'s yet but the DVD\\'s I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.\\n\\nOverall. This is a great price for the package.', 'well I found the lesson very good and worth the money I payed as far as the instrument it self found it to be sub par would of payed a few dollars more if the instrument was better quality but the lesson is great', 'Bought this as a starter kit for my daughter who wanted to learn how to play.  For the money, it is a great way to start and comes complete with all components well constructed.', \"Please don't listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldn't keep tune. They don't know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings. You have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch. Like all instruments, the strings have to stretch, especially with nylons, so be patient. It only took me about half an hour. It clearly states STARTER pack, so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele, especially because of the price. These people just do not know how to read. It has a great sound, but the 'lightweight gig bag' definitely is lightweight. If you want real protection, I would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines. it is a great buy though, considering the price. I highly recommend this product.\", 'book is good helps a lot with chords but uke is cheap and goes out of tune halfway though a song.', 'I have never played a string instrument... and it looks like I\\'ll be able to get the hang of this very quickly. Only problem is the strings. Sting one ... play\\'s \"dead\" meaning it will not stay in-tune. Not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem. Have another set of strings [better quality] and will try that set soon.', 'This is a good starter for children to learn, and easy to follow with the song book and whole family love it.', \"If your looking for a starter Uke and you want to learn, this is a good cheap way to start. Once the uke got tuned which takes about 2-3 days with the string stretch, it plays well and sounds good.\\nIt's fit and finish isn't the best, and the sound is marginal, but overall it's a real decent value. Later when I have achieved more experience and talent, I can upgrade. I have paid so little for this setup, that it is easy for me to pass it along to someone else that wants to learn the Uke and there is no real financial loss.\\nHint-Get the Snark SN-6 Ukulele Tuner. It is small and accurate, and makes Tuning a breeze.. which you will be doing a lot of the first few days. If it don't sound right to me, I just check it with the Snark.

I'd give it 5 stars if it were a better quality Uke... Plus it's a unit that can go on the road in a pack on a motorcycle, to the college dorm, and there is no worries your risking damage to an expensive unit. It's a perfect learning instrument. Then you can do with it what you want once your ready to upgrade... give it to a niece or nephew, grand child... send it off to college, you name it.. it will always be worth what you paid for it....\\nI have no negitives.. it is what it is... designed to be a starter Ukulele, and it preforms that task with class... I am not afraid to show or let pro's play it and look at it.. they are also impressed with its quality at the cost. I used lemon oil on it and hand rubbed it out to a dull luster, and put better strings on it.. so with that.. it is impressive for the cost.\\nThere are better Uke's on the market... those are for pro's. This is a starter unit.\", 'I purchased this set, based on the reviews, as a gift for a young neice.  Rather than just giftwrapping the box, I took the uke out, tuned it, retuned it, stretched the strings, retuned it.  After 2 days, it would hold tune for about 3 minutes of playing (junk strings are probably to blame).  I did all this because my neice would be a beginner and therefore be easily frustrated by an instrument that would not hold tune.  Next I went to a \"learn to play\" site on the net and found C Am F G7 chord diagrams and started to attempt to play.  The strings were so high off the fretboard that any note fingered above the 3rd fret would pull the string out of tune.  The easy chords were difficult because the high strings got in the way of my fingers so that I could not finger a chord cleanly.\\n\\nWith the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable.  In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords.  It sounded and played great!  I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one.  He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument.  Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from  Kala or Lanakai.  It played like the more expensive one, but didn\\'t have the pretty binding, etc.  I loved it and bought it.  When I got home I called for an RMA and will send the much inferior Firebrand uke with all the books and cd\\'s back to the seller.  The sellers were nice and seemed concerned about selling an unplayable instrument.  It\\'s too close to Christmas to waste time on this one.  Hope this helps you out.', 'This is a decent starter package for what it is:\\n\\n1. A Firebrand wood soprano ukulele with nylon strings. (More on this)\\n2.

The quality of strings and the quality of a cheap uke can be optimized to the point where it\\'s more than barely playable, and one mistake people make when taking up a musical instrument is to buy one that is so inexpensive, that it frustrates the learner. I have had this happen with the flute and the guitar. It really makes a difference what you learn on, and you have to balance the desire not to invest too much at first with the fact that too cheap a setup will just lead to failure.\\n\\nFor the record, I own a red Dolphin. I played uke as a kid and was able to pick up the instrument after 50 years of not playing, learn fingerstyle (picking) and enjoy playing it until I got a more serious instrument that indeed plays more sweetly. But I actually play the Dolphin quite a lot and enjoy its sound.\\n\\nThe setup I propose here will do you better as an adult, and will suit a child as well. You\\'ll spend about twice as much but your chances for success are, in my opinion, a lot better. There are some excellent sites to visit to get free advice and to subscribe to video lessons (ukulele underground is my favorite.) Check out what I say and see if others don\\'t agree with me.

Shortly thereafter I was playing LaBamba. I believe that it is important to make sure you install it absolutely in the proper position. I did find that it fits my Squier Strat better than the acoustic I also tried it on (although it does fit the acoustic, just not quite as well - a bit of string buzz, but still playable).\\nI can't speak as to whether the Chord Buddy will actually help with finger dexterity (it very well could) or help actually learning to play the chords (it might) since I've had it less than a week, but it certainly helps me work on timing & strumming as I mentioned above.\\nI do believe the Chord Buddy will be an excellent tool to get my daughter more interested in playing the guitar and that is definitely a good thing.

I'm sure\\nit will be great for people with arthritis that already play and want to continue playing without the pain.  I like the beginner cheat method to help me learn.\", 'I never used it yet. But my husband tried it out .He plays in a band with a guitar. And his comment was ,he was amaze on how it let you play. He said you have to learn where the color are with your finger. It was a bit awkward for him because he can play a guitar. But he said it would be great for me to teach me. Thank you', \"First off, if you're one of the people who've gotten this to work consistently, congrats and I'm glad you're happy.  There seems to be a lot of good reviews, so good for them.  And it is a great premise, the books/DVD are very well done.  Where it falls short for me is in the actual device.  The plastic 'fingers' tend to drift a bit (they are removable), and they hit each other and mess things up.  But the major flaw is how it attaches to the guitar.  It clamps to the neck on the sides, however, the Chord Buddy needs to stay above the strings (so as to not hit the wrong notes), so it also needs something to hold the top solidly.  But any pressure on the buttons causes it to 'fall' down a bit, making contact with the wrong strings.  I'm going to try to clamp it so this doesn't happen, but with the finger drift, I'm not sure this will work anyway.  One wonders what would have happened if they had used better materials?\\n\\nUpdate:  figured I'd post this, maybe it will help others.  I had to file some edges of the fingers that were rubbing against each other.  Then, in order to stop them from 'drifting' back into each other, I had to glue them (fingers not removable anymore!).  No biggie for me, as I don't see doing half Chord Buddy, half fingering anyway.  The biggest fix came in keeping the Chord Buddy from tilting down.  I took a rubber band and looped it over the rounded plastic (by the tightening screw), underneath the neck and hooked to the other side.  This gives it enough tension so as to not continually flop down.\\n\\nWhile it now works, I can't give a better grade.  For this much money, it should work well out of the box.\\n\\nSecond Update:  I also picked up a copy of Rocksmith.  I would have to say that Chord Buddy makes you feel like you are playing a song (strumming a few chords is all it is really doing).  Rocksmith lets you play single notes and then graduate to more, while also making you feel like you are playing along.  I would have to recommend Rocksmith over Chord Buddy, and it's cheaper to boot!\", \"I love the Chord Buddy!!! I have learned to play the guitar and have learned to strum so many ways!! I have shown it to my friends and one friend had me order one for her!!  I just can't say enough. If you love music, you will love this!!!  Karen Strader\", 'I\\'m slowly teaching myself to play guitar and picked up the Chord Buddy more as  novelty than anything else. I had no problem attaching it to the neck of the guitar - the instructions were a little confusing at first, but once I played with it a bit,  I was able to figure it out.  I will say it is fun to be able to play chords at the start and helps familiarize the absolute beginner (me) with how the chords work.  I can\\'t yet speak to how well the device helps you progress with learning the chords - it is a novel concept: you gradually remove the \"keys\" and finger the chords yourself, ultimately removing the device entirely once you\\'ve mastered the chords. I agree that it takes a bit of the frustration of learning, because you are playing chords right away, and I think that helps make learning fun.\\nReally, my only complaint is that it\\'s a bit expensive. The jury is still out as to whether it\\'s worth the price or not.', 'This books proves to be handy to any self-learner. I have been playing guitar for 4 years now, yet this book and the 7002 come with great pieces of advice. The eagle cartoons and illustrations are funny and go straight to the point. I recommend this book to anyone looking to learn guitar or anyone who might want to renforce concepts. Besides, it has an affordable price :)', 'The Ernie Ball series (1 & 2) is great for learning guitar basics.  Now you just need to practice, practice, practice.', 'I have been using QSC K10s for close to a couple of years now. I am a solo performer, playing a variety of styles from acoustic singer-songwriter stuff to loop-driven electro-rock. I typically play bars and have probably used these for nearly 100 gigs at this point.\\n\\n3 K10s along with an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Allen-Heath-ZED-10FX-Four-Mono-Mic-Lines-with-2-Active-D-I-3-Stereo-Line-Inputs-and-Onboard-Effects/dp/B003T77ZJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Allen & Heath ZED-10FX Four Mono Mic/Lines with 2 Active D.I., 3 Stereo Line Inputs and Onboard Effects</a>&nbsp;mixer make up my whole system, using two as mains and one as a monitor. My previous system was a powered Mackie box and passive 12\" speakers by Community and Yamaha.\\n\\nI have thus far been thrilled with the significant sound improvement I have experienced. The volume and clarity that these 10\" speakers produce is truly impressive. To give you an idea, I generally play rooms that are one to two thousand square feet in size and rarely turn my mains up much past 50%. At 60-75% levels (with mixer meters peaking around the zero mark) the music will cut through even the rowdiest bar noise.\\n\\nOne thing that\\'s great about this 10\" model is the throw. With a super-wide 90 degree dispersion angle, sound fills out the space up close within a few feet, depending on placement (I prefer getting them up as high as possible on stands and using the clever 7.5 degree tilt function). The dispersion angle is also matched between the woofer and tweeter so you\\'re never hearing just one or the other. 90 degrees is ideal for tight performance areas where you want people right in front of you to hear everything.\\n\\nThe trade-off here is that levels decrease quickly as you step back from the speakers. You can hear a significant difference as you get more than twenty or thirty feet away. While that could be seen as a negative especially for public address applications, I find it to be a win-win.  It essentially creates a \"full sound\" zone around the stage for the audience. I personally prefer creating a live music environment where people can hear a loud, full spectrum mix if they like but not have it forced on them wherever they are in the room. If your needs call for a speaker with more reach, the K12s (I\\'ve used them) throw a lot further and sound awesome as well.\\n\\nSpeaking of sound quality, I will say that while I think the K10 kicks the competition\\'s a** throughout the EQ, it is especially spectacular in the mids and highs. Just playing an iPod through them, you will hear separated parts of the music in this range that you never did before. As far as your perfomances go, vocals and guitars will sparkle in a way you probably haven\\'t heard out of a small cabinet.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to downplay the bass response on these though. It is huge and far more than you would expect out of these little guys. The frequency coverage is absolutely there and can even be boosted if you utilize the DEEP switch. What you will NOT hear in the lower registers however is a ton of attack. They are more suited to adequately express a jazzy upright bass than they are to throw down the punch you want to hear from electronica or hip-hop (unless we\\'re talking smaller spaces, they\\'ll ROCK a house party DJs). Impressive but you\\'ll find no magic here, that\\'s why they make the Ksub.\\n\\nProspective buyers should also know that the 1 KW amp in these is Class D. That\\'s not equivalent to 1000 watts in Class A for example. It\\'s more than sufficient though and Class D amps are great for their light weight and power efficiency. I plug mine into a surge protector that powers a bunch of other devices simultaneously and have never had an issue.\\n\\nSignal routing is wildly flexible with the fantastic panel on the back. You can do whatever you want with these including play a small gig with one speaker alone. Just plug a mic, an instrument, and an iPod directly in.\\n\\nErgonomics are well done too. Knobs and switches are not fancy but easy to operate. There\\'s also super sturdy, comfy handles on the top and on one side. Carrying two at once is easy (32 lbs. each) and saves you a trip back to the car.\\n\\nThe build quality is solid. I\\'ve always been careful with them but not used cases or bags and the only damage thus far has been cosmetic. The sides will scuff up pretty easily so use the duffels if thats important to you.\\n\\nI have not observed any malfunction up to this point other than some buzzing from the monitor once when it got rained on. After drying out, it didn\\'t happen again. QSC has also put some serious limiting circuitry into these as well to protect themselves from blowing. I have more than once pushed my monitor too hard and reached this threshold. The signal simply cuts out when the the speaker cone experiences too much travel. Once you readjust the levels, you\\'re back in business with no issue.\\n\\nI can\\'t think of much to gripe about, the whole K series was very well thought out. I would love to incorporate a Ksub at some point as the crossover function is built into the entire line. These speakers aren\\'t cheap at $700 a piece but you\\'ll be paying for quality and design that cannot be found elsewhere.', \"I like this speaker. I bought a pair of K10s because I wanted a stereo image for my piano and the clarity and presence are phenomenal. Un-muddied left hand bass and crisp high notes. I'm hearing subtleties in my keyboard that I haven't heard before. I'm using them on stands behind me in my Irish band to mic an accordion and tin whistle and they both sound great with these speakers running through an 8 channel Yamaha mixer.\\n\\nAt 32lbs, they're easy to carry around, especially with the totes, and light to get up on stands. These speakers go really loud, so it's nice that I can set the speaker fader only half way and still get good volume. Really helps prevent feedback from the condenser  mics.\", 'Best bang for the buck.  Great bass for a 10\" speaker - perfect for singer/guitar player plus I use it as my monitor for the rock and roll band.  Excellent quality.  Enough inputs to bypass a mixer but I still use a Yamaha to fine-tune the sound.\\nI have two of these plus an EV ZLP powered 12\" speaker as a monitor but if I had the money I\\'d have 3 of these instead.  Buy with confidence.', 'I bought these offered in a special bundle on Amazon. They are in a class by themselves - really a top product. I have pro speaker gear from JBL, Mackie and Cerwin Vega. They are all good, but for me, these QScs are simply the best for sound quality/clarity, loudness and integrated power (500W per driver = 1000W per cabinet). When you then further consider the portability, functionality and performance, they are fully worth their premium price tag. I was initially sceptical about the high price, having bought them after all my others, and for more money, but I now think they may well have been my best-value purchase of the lot. I certainly use them more than all the others for convenience including outside jobs with potentially suspect weather (I got the matching outdoor speaker covers and so they can play on their stands outdoors in light rain). I remember at an outdoor gig once, the wind blew my projector screen unto my K10 speaker and stand, so that the K10 fell about 7ft to the hard asphalt ground. It suffered a small dent on the front grill (was in the cover), but did not skip a beat and kept right on playing through the incident, and have continued on with no problems ever since\\n\\nAll in all, a really fine powered pro speaker. You can get many alternatives for much less, but I think this is really outstanding value for money', \"Although it seems pricey, I've got to say that this is the best sounding powered speaker I have ever heard or used. It is awesome for vocals - rich and full, excellent clarity. Awesome for acoustic guitar and violin - very natural sounding. Very good for recorded music. It's not particularly great for bass guitar, but it's OK. Great coverage, it opens up right away, short throw situations this works very well. This thing is LOUD but still very clear. If they weren't so expensive, I'd have bought another one already. I think I need a sub for the bass, though.\", 'recib una referencia diferente a la comprada por lo cual no cumpli con la satisfaccin del cliente sin embrago me retornaron el excedente', \"These speakers definitely have a decent sound.  I would pair them with the sub for the best sound.  I do have a couple of issues with my speakers though.  The shipping boxes are not the most protective.  There is no foam inside the box just a piece of cardboard on top and bottom.  Hence, both grills had dents in them from shipping.  Fortunately, I was able to tap them out but they are not perfect and should be when bought new.\\n\\nThe other issue is that one of the fans comes on very quickly and is considerably louder than the other fan.  The QSC tech said it was normal because the speakers were meant to be used in a loud environment and fan noise was given no consideration.  I don't buy it since the other speaker's fan is much quieter.\\n\\nStill I think the speakers are a good buy.\", \"These are definitely great and light weight to use as monitors for a 4+ piece live band, but did not satisfy my expectations while using it for mains. It is great as mains for a single to a trio act, but not beyond if you want that solid full sound of a 4+ live band. It's basically personal preference, therefore for my use, it's limited to being a good source for monitors. And the quality is superb but don't lay it on its grill when using the carrying bags because the grill dents easily.\", 'I can only compare these with the Yamaha DXR (?) series.

The MS907 sounds fuller and richer, but frankly I did not judge it to be superior to the overall effect of the 4-point microphone that comes with the popular Zoom H-2.  Whether or not you choose to use it in place of the onboard mic of a high-end personal audio recorder really comes down to a matter of personal taste.  On the other hand, if you\\'ve picked up the new Zoom H-4n, this Sony stereo mic would be an excellent choice for complementing the onboard ones since the new Zoom allows for use of onboard and external mics simultaneously.\\n\\nAs for recording to a software audio program on an iMac, that particular computer has an audio input that will accommodate the 3.5mm plug (but be aware that many computers do not have such an input--in that case, look at a USB mic such as those from Blue).

Just takes a little effort to learn, like most worthwhile activities.\", \"Bought this for my daughter's birthday. Without any prior experience playing a recorder, you may get some squeaks on the lower notes. That's common and easy to correct. Usually, you're blowing too hard or you're not covering the wholes tightly. Also, you can make a note sound sharp or flat by blowing too hard or by blowing weakly. It's a musical instrument. You have to LEARN how to play it. Go to YouTube for help.\\nThis recorder sounds clear and loud. Hole spacing seems correct. The holes are easy to cover and there is a clear distinction between notes.\\nThick plastic makes it feel durable, but it's very light weight which makes it easier to play faster (since you aren't using much hand strength and coordination to hold the instrument up).\\nLike any instrument, it will require some practice to get the hang of it and get proficient, but this is pretty easy to play. Meaning, you can get a good, strong sound and play some simple songs on it right away.

First, it\\'s nearly indestructible (and trust me, between me, the kids, and various pets we have tried to destroy this).  Secondly, you can indeed get very nice music out of it.  Not talking \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" music but decent tunes with trills, etc. -  the experience of the player is what matters.  Third,  I like not having to mess around with the \"playing in\" requirements of nicer wooden instruments.  I can throw this recorder in a basket for weeks on end and then play it for as long as I want to play it without having to worry about it being humidified properly.  HOWEVER, the tuning of this instrument is frankly a little bit luck of the draw.  My recorder runs flat at the higher register (starting with high C and getting flatter as it goes). My daughter\\'s Yamaha runs sharp in about the same area.  The tuning issue honestly isn\\'t very noticeable if we\\'re playing by ourselves, but is pretty awful sounding when we play together.  Now if you\\'re really into ensemble work, you buy a nice wooden instrument and make sure the shop checks and fixes the tuning before you take it home. This is a mass produced recorder and - if you\\'re buying it online - you get what you get. That said, it really is decent for the price and once you (or your kid) gets the hang of it, you can blow a little harder or softer to correct the majority of manufacturer imprecisions.\\n\\nETA:  Note that this recorder is the *Baroque* version, which is what my kid uses in school.  This means that the low F is split fingered (fingers down on left plus 1&3 on right... and yep, two fingers is good enough to sound in tune and easier to learn for beginners)', \"Hey, iT's a yamaha!

I don't know much about classical but it is not what I would call great playability.  Of course, you can play on this guitar, I do.  But it's hard.  I suppose, one shouldn't expect much from $100 dollars instrument.  But I repeat, it's not great.  Now about bass strings.  They sound bassy, as I suppose, they must.  But the thing is their bassines overpower trebles. Trebles sound unproportionally weak. And yes, yes.  I did changed strings on a good ones (D-Adario normal tension something) upon getting this guitar from Amazon  I should say though that guitar starts to sound much better now than it was when I just got it.  But action on this instrument still kills my fingers.  I do finger pushups in order to develop muscle on my phalanges, in order, to play on this guitar somehow.  Of course, I could ask professional to fix bridge nut, but why would I do it for such cheap guitar.  My verdict-unless you want to develop your fingers, in order, to pull out nail with your bare hands, go for it.  I will send it back, and buy myself inexpensive Spanish brand.\", 'It came fresh new in box. In very great condition.

As a primarily electric player, I find myself reaching for this guitar much more often than I reach for my much more expensive Seagull entourage rustic steel string acoustic. I have played much more expensive classical guitars, and, though they may feel slightly better, they sound about the same, and offer the same range of tonal possibilities (maybe a true classical guitarist might beg to differ, but for the occasional gipsy kings play along, latin jazz/bossa nova, and Bouree in E minor, it is quite acceptable). It comes rather decently set up out of the box, as I've never had to change a thing, it takes abuse rather well, sounds and looks pretty good, and definitely won't break the bank. It's definitely a guitar that you won't be afraid to take places, and will never regret bringing along if you do.

That's why my friend gave it to me.\\nI went thru the set up myself to lower action at the nut and action at fret#12. Now it plays really smooth, easy on my fingers. This is not something a casual guitar player or newbee knows.\\nMost string instruments, when newly bought, need to go thru a setup to be playable. Sometimes you are lucky that the action is low enough and this can be skipped.\\nThe sound is good for this price range. It does not sound as good a a few 5000$ I had chance to play and that's all expected.\\nI even go further to install a preamp/under-saddel transducer to turn it into electric.\\nPlugging into an amp, it sounds amazing. I can play, amplified, on stage with it.\", \"I got this guitar 2003 and seven years later it still has an amazing sound. This guitar has a strong neck and keeps its tune for a long time. Many people have played this guitar and just love how it sounds. This guitars quality is as good as any classical guitar, the price is a good deal. You won't regret buying this guitar. I use Augustine classical guitar strings, I also use Pro Arte (Normal Tension EJ45C) classical guitar strings which sound really good (highly recommended). For those who are first time guitar buyers...NEVER put steel strings on a classical guitar because the neck is not strong enough and it will bend or snap. Classical guitar strings are nylon. Keep guitar away from extreme heat. This guitar looks nice and has a gloss finish. The neck is not too big or too small, it's just right. Handling is good and has a white mark indicating the 7th fret where you can easily see it.\", \"I recently took this guitar off the wall rack in my home studio where it sat for 2 years and played it and  stayed nearly in tune, it was only a flat from standard E tuning.

It was one I bought used from a friend\\'s guitar teacher. I loved that guitar. Never did I have a single complaint about it. And I had it with me everywhere I went until I was almost 40 years old.\\n\\nMy son was an avid electric guitar player who wanted to give acoustic a try. Since I didn\\'t have time to play my guitar during that time of my life I LENT my guitar to him. When I eventually had more free time and wanted to get back into my music I asked my son to please return my guitar, the one I let him BORROW. It was at that time he informed me that he SOLD it to a buddy when he needed money buy a Fender bass. Kids...\\n\\nSo...I bought this one and am very happy to have a Yamaha Classical Guitar back in my possession. The only differences I can see between my old one and this one are the colors and design around the sound hole and the absence of Yamaha on the headstock. To be sure this was the brand of classical guitar I wanted, I tried several different brands and models available on Amazon.com at local guitar stores.\\n\\nEvery other brand of classical guitar, regardless of the price, did not hold up to the sound of the Yamaha guitars. I\\'m not saying the other brands did not sound good. What I\\'m saying is the Yamahas sounded great. Should I ever decide to upgrade to a better classical guitar, I will stay with Yamaha.\\n\\nI could not find a lower price for this model than the Amazon.com price...anywhere. Having the Free Shipping option was a major plus.\\n\\nThere is only one reason I needed to call the Yamaha Customer Support Line. I needed to ask where the serial number is located. I couldn\\'t find it to save my life. On the C40, look inside the sound hole to the inside edge of the fretboard.\\n\\nMy guitar was wrapped very well for shipping. It came with \"The Yamaha Guitar Quickstart DVD.\" The DVD has some very useful information to help you get started if you have no idea what to do with your guitar once you take it out of the box. A \"Welcome\" sheet with some good basics for beginners was also included.\\n\\nIt is so good to have another Yamaha Classsical Guitar back in my life.', 'If you read this it means you in the same point where I had been some time ago and I hope my advise will help you as much as the same advise had helped to me.\\n\\nEssentially it is pointless to discuss some hypothetic \"classical guitar\" on the web. In the same way as all we, people, have the same hands, legs and heads but have different nature and voices, the guitars, even of the same model of the same manufacturer may differ wildly.\\n\\nThe Classical guitar has to be made of wood. And wood, even of the same age and tree has much of personality and much of \"specifics in sound.\\n\\nIf you consider this guitar you are shopping in the lowest end for cheap instrument. Well do not do it! Because I doubt you will learn it ever.\\n\\nFirst of all buy the real Spanish guitar. I mean Spanish made in Span not the \"Spanish\" made in China or anywhere else. Spanish guitars, even the cheapest made toward sound, not toward look. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, it will sound as a toilet sitting and you never will be able to get decent sound out of it. The quality of sound is very important while playing classical guitar and you produce the sound with your hands. It is crucially important to learn to produce right sound by positioning fingers and nails properly: you will never learn it with cheap, not authentic guitar, because it will sound the same whatever you will try! It is like a car that make only left turn. Then you will try to play the real guitar not the bogus one , you will find youself incapable to make it sound as other players do.\\n\\nDo not try to choose guitar yourself because you can\\'t produce any reasonable judgment until you will learn how to make it sound properly, you must take someone who actually knows how to play classical guitar. You have to get  a decent instrument because you MUST fall in love with the sound of one, otherwise it is pointless: you play guitar because it fascinates you esthetically. I doubt that toilet sitting sound out of shipping box that pretends to produce music will fascinate you!\\n\\nOnce again, Spanish guitar improves with an age but not one with the laminated top. If you in budget, do not trash you money with cheap Chinese garbage but save more instead and by the real thing.\\n\\nHere we are, these are my recommendations for those who really seek to learn to play classical/Spanish guitar:\\n\\n1. Do not buy guitar online, buy it in the local Guitar Center for example! Listen to the actual instrument. If you like the sound take it!\\n\\n2. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, they are guitar only by appearance.\\n\\n3.

We proposed plopping down nearly 4 C-notes on a dozen 20-foot Standard 100 mike cables to our church\\'s finance council.  The words \"Lifetime Warranty\" were the clincher.\\n\\nHum? Forget about it. Cell phone static? Thing o\\' the past. CB radio interference? Tunes it right out. The secret is twisted pair construction, which eats up an extra inch or so of wire per foot of finished cable. The signal becomes its own electronic shield against noise. Cheaper cables use a side-by-side or linear configuration.  It saves wire and keeps the price down but the cable acts as an antenna and attracts all kinds of electromagnetic junk from the air.\\n\\nThe jacket resists twisting and uncoils smoothly. It also rolls up for storage without fighting back like a snake that\\'s had a few espresso shots.\\n\\nThe ends are finished with somewhat oversize connectors, providing a generous grip for smooth insertion and removal, but they can be a hindrance for performers who like a grab a mike off the stand and solo. That\\'s not a problem in a church choir, so we expect the cables to last a long time. If you need a cable with a slimmer connector, move up to the Performer 500 or Studio Pro 1000 series.\\n\\nThe finishing touch in our sound setup is the Monster Cable S-100 instrument patch cord and an attenuating adapter for hooking our mixer to the sound system.

Monster throws lots of techno-babble around about things like \"time correct windings\" but if the cable doesn\\'t work it doesn\\'t matter how good it is.  Their higher end products make more of a difference in sound quality than their entry level line.\\n\\nMonster makes three series of progressively more expensive microphone cables which are the 100 (this one), the 500 (BETTER) and 1000 (BEST.)  This \"100\" cable series is their \"entry level\" mic cable and their lightest weight XLR cable series with the smallest diameter cable.\\n\\nWhile the cable itself is small in diameter, the 100 series cable has big fat MOLDED-ON XLR connectors, the presence of which creates with two drawbacks.  First, if they break you can\\'t fix them and you just have to cut them off and replace them.  Second, when you pull a Shure SM-57 or SM-58 size mic out of the stand adapter these fat molded connectors don\\'t slide as smoothly through the stand adapter as a standard Switchcraft type connector would.\\n\\nWhen these connectors go bad, you could buy a new Switchcraft connector and solder it on which would void the warranty, but the cable is not user serviceable otherwise.  Since they have a \"LIFETIME\" warranty on all Monster products, instead of fixing it you can get it replaced free and I\\'m of the opinion that this warranty is why this cable costs about twice what it should. Plus you have to do without the cable for a while until you get the replacement.\\n\\nThere are a multitude of other manufacturers making good reliable mic cables and some have better material quality than the Monster 100. Aside from the Monster lifetime warranty you\\'d be just as well off with a quality cable from another quality line and in some cases better off.  Some of the other manufacturers also have a lifetime warranty.\\n\\nThe color coding was a nice idea, but from 30 feet away the tech won\\'t be able to see the little colored insert stripe ring.  3-M Mystic tape is the time proven color coding material anyway.\\n\\nCables with these molded on type connectors would be more suitable for a permanent installation such as a church or meeting hall or infrequent use than for a band that plays a different room every night.  They are not as durable as one with standard Switchcraft or Neutrik XLR connectors.\\n\\nIf you must have a Monster mic cable and if you are going to be using the cable a lot, or using it in a critical situation I\\'d step up at least to the 500 series or try another reliable name brand like Planet Waves or the Horizon brand which are very well made.  I\\'ve also had good luck with the Shure brand cables which is a very economical solution.\\n\\nThere are also a number of small companies selling custom made Mogami or Canare mic cables.  Just do an internet search on Mogami mic cable.  In many recording studios you can usually find Mogami and/or Canare brand cables.\\n\\nI do use the pricier Monster instrument cables which are worth at least some of the extra money to me.  I own two of those and they have been good cables.  These Series 100 Microphone cables are better than nothing, but no cable is 100% failsafe so I\\'d keep a spare handy.

After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.

It sounds like most of the bad reviews were written by people who had purchased this for a mic that needs a different type of cable, or who don\\'t understand the wiring of this cable and it\\'s intended function.  With only one exception, this cable is NOT designed for a stereo camera.  That exception being a stereo microphone that uses a male 3-pin XLR jack to output an unbalanced, stereo feed across pins 2 and 3 (with pin 1 being ground).  Excepting that very rare microphone type, this should not be used for a stereo camera.\\n\\nThis cable is a BALANCED cable.  It is designed for Balanced XLR microphones (pretty much any professional microphone) to connect to a camera or device that uses a BALANCED 1/8\" TRS microphone input jack.  It is wired Pin 1 to Sleeve, Pin 2 to tip, and Pin 3 to Ring.  Again, it should not be used for anything with a stereo input on a 1/8\" TRS jack.\\n\\nFor those people wanting to use a professional XLR microphone with a stereo camcorder, you need to search for a mono XLR to Stereo 1/8\" TRS cable.  I have one, that I purchased from Amazon and it works very well for my stereo cameras.  This is not that cable.\\n\\nNow, that said, Here\\'s my review... It does what it is supposed to do.  I don\\'t really know what else to say.  I purchased this to use with my T2i running Magic lantern that allows the use of balanced mics on the external input.  When I run my T2i with the mic jack as a stereo input, I have to use my other adapter or my stereo microphone with it\\'s own cable.  The wiring seems fine, though a little on the fragile side.  With normal home/amateur use, this will work fine.  For professional use, you probably won\\'t be using any cameras with an 1/8\" jack anyway.  If it used a bit heavier cable and a Neutrik connector, I would give it 5 stars, but then it would cost a lot more.  For what it is, it\\'s actually just fine.\\n\\nI guess my only real complaint is that it looks identical to my XLR to stereo 1/8\" TRS cable, so I had to use a sharpie to mark this one as being balanced and mark my other one as being stereo.  Not a big deal, but something to keep in mind if you get multiple Hosa adapters.\\n\\nEdit to add:  here is the link to the stereo cable that most people should get...

This past year, I bought a Kirlin cable, this Hosa cable, a GLS Audio cable, and a Seismic Audio cable.  Of the bunch, the Kirlin is my favorite -- it's clear that the metal connector design and the strain reliefs are designed for heavy duty usage. The cable thickness is also the largest diameter of the 4 I bought, and the weave of the braid is tight. Overall, if I had to guess which cable was going to last the longest, I'd guess the Kirlin one. It will last forever used just my house; if I were to ever start gigging again, I'd guess it would last at least a few years of hard gigging, or quite a few years of light gigging. That said, this was also the second most expensive of the above cables -- by just a few dollars, sure, but if you absolutely know the cable won't be subject to much abuse, the Hosa or GLS Audio also seem great without compromising too much on quality.\\n\\nThis Hosa is my second favorite; it seems a bit more durable than the GLS Audio. The strain reliefs on this cable are not as beefy as on the Kirlin, but plenty good enough for indoor play. If you play out at all or do more than just sitting in the same chair every time you practice, I would consider the Kirlin. At the time I purchased, the Kirlin was actually a little cheaper than the Hosa, which made it a better value. The Hosa is lighter and more flexible than the Kirlin, though, which you might prefer for indoor play. If my Hosa is closer by, I definitely don't bother looking for the Kirlin -- in fact, the Hosa is the one that stays plugged in most of the time, just because that's how things happened to end up.\\n\\nThe Seismic Audio is the style I used to buy in high school -- definitely wouldn't rely on it for gigging, but it should be fine for most practice session use.\\n\\nI am playing through a small modeling amp (Fender Mustang I v2), and usually play with some light effects on -- so I'm not going through a sound system where you might really discern the difference between these inexpensive cables and a high end cable (I might be wrong about that, but wouldn't know since I've never owned a cable more than $25 before). I briefly considered a fancier cable, but honestly haven't felt like anything was missing given my current setup. If you are of a similar mindset, you won't miss out on anything with this Hosa cable.\", \"I had minimal use on this cable and it lasted about two weeks. As a kid with no money I always used the cheapest cables I could find, when they broke I would take them apart and solder them back together. You buy better stuff as you get older and wiser, I've used monster cables for about 15 years and never had a problem, I needed a cable in a hurry and didn't want to spend the money on one that wasn't going to see much action, I should have just spent the extra money.\\nIf you are looking for a cable I would look elsewhere, you get what you pay for.\", 'HOSA Cables, Once again , Rock On!!', \"Good cable for the price.

I own a live event video company and I shoot a lot of weddings. The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say, half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though, the signal is to hot, the music is crap, or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time. This product has improved my productions beyond it's price sold. I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJ's wireless systems to my own audio recorder.

My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short, so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singer's microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground, or horizontally placed, but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand.\", 'This works so great.

The R21 did well when it came to amplifying acoustic instruments, so I was able to find a use for them, while using my entry-level Shure for vocals and just regular speaking, which that handled a lot better.\\n\\nThen, when I purchased a portable Behringer sound system, their XM1800S microphone came with it, so I was introduced to that. The XM1800S also comes in a three pack that's about $5 less, but it gets compared to the Shure SM58, with some professionals preferring it to the standard Shure microphone. So, I ordered the three pack of XM1800S, and am keeping the Samson R21's strictly as instrument microphones.\\n\\nI want to end this review by saying I don't hate the Samson R21 mics. They just weren't cutting it on vocals, but they have done well when it comes to instruments.

Yes, you generally get what you pay for - and I may upgrade one day to a more expensive mic system. But so far, I am very impressed with the PRO 88W set.\\n\\nI have uploaded a video review that is hopefully more informative and demonstrative of this system and its performance. Please take a look at it if you have the time, it might help you with your purchase decision.\\n\\nI plan to use this system indoors and outdoors - and sometimes in harsh environments.  I may do some updates to this review over time, to note (good or bad) how it performs over time and different projects.\\n\\nProduct information says to expect an average of 8 hours for the battery life. The use of the system requires two 9-volt batteries (one each in the receiver and the transmitter).', \"Its works fine, range is ok a long theres' no interfering hi-tension cables or cell antennas nearby, is not 100% noise free, it does have a tiny little noise and your gonna discover that in post-editing ... but sound/voice is clear and is STEREO, wiring a little delicate so keep in mind not letting get tangle often .. excellent good for amateurish urban video or film ... if you want broadcast quality sound then this is not for you .. you're gonna need to edit audio separately on software to reduce the hiss/noise .. for the price is a nice set overall !\", 'Product arrived and was much better than expected given the price. I hooked it up to my Pro Camcorder and it worked like a charm.  I used the wireless mic to create professional/studio quality training videos and it worked perfectly.  If you use a camcorder stop using the built in mic and get a good wireless one like this.', 'This is an excellent all around solid performer. When compared to a stock Shure 92E, this Audio Technica 92ECD stands head and shoulders above the stock Shure in terms of high frequency response-cymbals etc. I\\'m sure the narrower elliptical stylus helps. However, a Shure M92e with an upgraded stylus gives this AT a good run for the money. No, the AT\\'s not as \"neutral\" sounding as the Shure, but, to my ear anyway is also quite balanced. This is a good basic upgrade cartridge. It\\'s not an \"audiophile\" contender but reproduces music nicely, well beyond most basic cartridges. Good \"universal\" value especially in that it can be used as either a P mount or standard. Have a listen, you can\\'t go wrong for the price.', 'This particular Audio Technica cartridge will suprisingly enough yield very crisp and clear audio quality. Bass response is tight but not overwhelming nor weak. The wonderful thing about this type of cartridge is that it\\'s basically a plug and play set up (just have to tighten a screw to hold it in place with most P-mount systems). The elliptical stylus or tip is designed for better contact with the stereo groove walls in a record resulting in better frequency response and clarity. The user does not have to worry about how much stylus pressure,weight, or anti-skating to provide to get the most from this cartridge;that\\'s the beauty of using this cartridge on a P-mount tonearm instead of as a standard one...This cartrdige will perform admirably when used for regular record listening conditions. This is not a DJ stylus to scratch with as you may damage the needle and the record (\"burn\"). Also, it is more suitable for playing any kind of music except classical or jazz where a high end audiophile cartridge/needle would be needed. Such a high end cartridge and needle would bring out extreme musical detail as well as the ambiance or \"air\" of the instruments. Also, that would allow for better stereo separation as well... This is only a better than average cartridge meaning that you will only get about maybe a little over a year\\'s worth of use from it (if you played one or 2 records a day or every 2 days respectively). That is also the difference between a basic low priced cartridge/stylus versus an audiophile grade one (those can usually go for about 5 years---but you would be talking anywhere from hundreds to maybe thousands of dollars).', 'a nice stylus', \"Needed a replacement for one of our turntables. Looked for something decent that didn't cost too much. Was preparing to spend about 50.00 until I ran across this one. Hooked it up and gave it a whirl and was very, very surprised at how good it sounds. It is right there on top. Better than the Signet it replaces and even better than the Stanton 881S. The latter of which has aged some 40 years so that may not be a fair comparison. The Stanton was state of the art for it's day and still sounds decent but figured, I don't spin the vinyl a lot so a decent cartridge would be more than adequate. Audio Technica has always made decent products. Their Mics and other equipment is reliable as it gets. You won't spend a lot of money but you will get a good product. Now, this cartridge is a bargain but sounds as good as some of the top selling ones selling for many times  the price. That's a huge bonus. With Amazon's great return policy, I figured it was worth a try and if it sounded awful, I could return it. Won't need to do that. It's a great find. I would not hesitate to get it again.\\n\\nPros: Great sound, all the hardware for both mounts are included. Highs and lows are well defined but not overpowering. Just clean. Mids are crystal clear. That is what we used to dream about in the old days. I couldn't see spending the money on a better one when these do so well and they do not require a lot of tracking force. That, alone, is a real bonus.\\n\\nCons: None.\\nBottom line: Great cartridge. Very reasonable price.\", \"I replaced a p-mount cartridge with this fellow, and it works well for listening to tunes on a pioneer turntable.

This was more of a sentimental gesture for me.\", \"Below applies to the AT311EP; for some crazy reason Amazon bundles a dozen or more cartridges together which are in some cases nothing alike, yet the reviews all flow as if they were one.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\nYou cannot beat the value of this cartridge.\\n\\nFor one, the cost of the stylus itself is a few hairs shy of the cost Amazon offers the whole enchilada for.  Second, the performance of AT's is second-to-none for the P-mount form-factor.  Those of us, myself included, with a turntable taking this format find ourselves with dwindling options.  When I decided to replace the cartridge I bought my used Denon DP-7F with, I was nervous as I liked the sound the ADC (no model anywhere!) was putting out.  I ordered an AT3482 initially, which it turns out is an entry model void of any depth and life.  Harsh and cold, I disappointingly put the original back (aware with an unknown number of hours on the clock it could be wearing my vinyl faster), and I got Amazon to kindly take the 3482 back and sell me a 311EP.\\n\\nImmediately apparent was the increased clarity, depth, spatial separation, and eventually came the greater warmth.  It was sufficient off the bat, but I found (and have read others have had the same experience) that some time in, it gets the groove (pun intended) and shows its true colors.  I can say this was the case for me, and as long as you keep it clean with a stylus cleaner you will have a very pleasant experience.\\n\\nI can also say that a friend's house with Magnepan speakers off a vintage Carver amp and a Technics turntable with a very similar model cartridge gave depth and spatialization out of this world for this price point on Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here.\\n\\nThe instructions when you open the packaging tell you (out of an abundance of caution I hope) to remove the stylus from the cartridge when installing, then reinsert.  This looks easy on paper, but I couldn't get it to separate, and I was applying more than sufficient force to my thinking.  I can see why, you could bump into the needle with one of your fingers while pushing into the tonearm and then game over, but you just hold it by the sides, slide it in, then screw it down, and less than a minute later all is well.  You can't really make adjustments on the P-mount system, so you will get it right and without delay.\\n-------------------------------------------------------Below applies to the AT100E----------------------------------------\\nJust installed a month ago in a 1979 Dual 1264.  The Pickering XV15 from some time ago had the vintage look, and after I'd restored the Dual I tried to keep that look intact, starting with a new stylus to replace the original D400.  Turned out the tunnel the stylus went into was worn, and the assembly itself would come loose with playing and that of course is dangerous and resulted in poor sound.  Another $90 in to a labor of love, and enter the AT100E, which looks good and sounds good.\\n\\nRight off the bat, one difference between it and the EV stylus I tried to replace the D400 with (and even the AT311EP's I love) was that out of the box the sound was natural.  The EV stylus had lots of surface noise for a few hours, then dramatically settled down (I also cleaned it once but that didn't seem to do much), the AT311EP's settle down nicely after about 5-10 hours.  I've got about 20 hours on the clock with this one and it hasn't changed, which is impressive to me; maybe this will change in months' time.\\n\\nI am running the tracking force (at the recommendation of the shop that restored the Dual) close to the upper limit of 1.8 (I'm at 1.75, while the manual states optimal is 1.4).  The anti-staking is just shy of 2, and every so often it seems the right channel has some distortion which may mean I need to make a skating adjustment, but I have no blank vinyl to test it on (yet).\\n\\nThe needle doesn't ride quite as low as the AT311EP, which appears dangerously close to the vinyl, but never touches, even with a warp.  I miss the dust cap on the old cartridge/stylus, but am glad to stick with AT.  Much of my vinyl isn't new, esoteric 180g limited edition purchases, more of the good and great shape used copies from the Bay Area and Sacramento (a haven for collectors), so getting into the diminishing return rare air of uber equipment is not my gig.\\n\\nThe bass could use some extra umph, but what is there is warm and not overwhelming.  Highs are very natural and never harsh.  Jazz such as Miles Davis' Kind of Blue and Maynard really show the brass instruments and percussion.  LOTS of stereo separation, impressive staging if you sit in the sweet spot of your speakers.\", 'The needle on this cartridge is too shallow so the body rubs on the record. I modified one to work but I would not buy it again....', 'Detailed, accurate, and musical characteristics. Comes with the full kit of hardware for use on either 1/2 mount (adapter) or p-mount.\\n\\nInstalled on technics sl-j2 with ease. Excellent playback quality.  Very pleased. Inclusion of mini screwdriver and stylus brush is a bonus.', 'No makers I know about are producing a turntable that has a P-Mount tone arm.  For legacy turntables that require a P-Mount/T4P cartridge along with a record collection in excellent condition your choices for something better than a \"starter\" cartridge in the $25 to $70 range continue to dwindle.  Many major cartridge makers have eliminated all but their lesser P-Mount cartridges while others like Ortofon stopped making any T4P (P-mount) cartridge at all.  The AT-311EP is possibly the best sounding P-Mount cartridge still widely available at a price that about anyone can afford.  This AT311EP is not the best T4P/P- Mount cartridge ever made or even the best one still available at any price but in the price range it performs way beyond the cost.  (If you have more money to spend the Grado Black T4P is $75 and the Gold Grado T4P is something over $200.  The AT311EP specs approach the Grado Black for way less money.)\\n\\nAudio-Technica actually recently listed this AT311EP as \"discontinued\" on their website, so I thought those in the supply chain were all there would be. The ATN3472SE replacement stylus is safe since the AT92ECD uses the same stylus and that cartridge was not discontinued.  Then came good news that for some unknown reason Audio-Technica changed their mind so the AT311EP webpage no longer carries the \"discontinued\" stamping as of 04/04/2015.  So the AT311EP has been snatched back from the jaws of death. Very unusual for a discontinued product to make a comeback, but I\\'m glad and it was a good save.\\n\\nThe AT311EP is better than even other AT cartridges that look cosmetically identical, such as the AT92ECD, which costs a few dollars less.  The others are cheaper but the extra few bucks for the AT311EP is a good investment. The first reason I say the AT311EP is better is the ATN3472SE stylus used on both the AT311EP and AT92ECD is elliptical (also known as bi-radial) and is not conical (also known as spherical.)  This particular stylus is very narrow so it goes deeper into the groove than other elliptical styli in the cartridge\\'s price range. The difference seems to matter less sound wise with a 45, but with a 33 microgroove album in excellent condition the difference in higher frequencies is obvious.  The AT92ECD cartridge has nearly identical specs to the AT311EP in all regards except for a 30% lower output voltage of 3.5 mv instead of the robust 5.0 mv output on this AT311EP.  The higher output of the AT311EP translates to a stronger signal for an improved signal to noise ratio.  To me the significantly higher output voltage from the AT311EP is more than worth the few dollars difference.\\n\\nAs an alternative choice the Shure M92E is another widely available and popular P-Mount elliptical option and a fair value too.  Shure now calls the M92E stylus \"bi-radial\" yet suffix that model with an \"E\" which has almost always has meant there is an elliptical stylus in a Shure phono cartridge.\\n\\nThe second reason I say the AT311EP is maybe the best affordable P-Mount cartridge left is the overall specs compared to others in the price class.  In output voltage it equals the Shure M92E but surpasses it in almost every other category and it should since the Audio-Technica is slightly more expensive.  Of course specs can be manipulated to say whatever the manufacturer wants by leaving out things like + or - dB or the specific frequency of a measurement tone.  However in the case of the AT311EP the incredibly wide range of reproduction specified at 15-27,000 Hz clues you into it being a very bright cartridge that also has a big low end.  AT does not spec a dB plus or minus tolerance in their frequency response spec, but the AT311EP has a brighter and more airy character than the Shure M92E while being equally robust in output and it exceeds the Shure in channel separation and channel balance specs.  The airy tone in the AT311EP cartridge works great with clean records in excellent shape but it can get annoyingly noisy on worn bargain bin records.\\n\\nShould you ever choose the Shure M92E over the AT311EP?  Yes.  When you have records in only fair to good shape and they are not perfectly clean the Shure M92E would be a more prudent choice since it tames at least some of surface noise present in worn or dirty discs.  So when should you choose the AT311EP?  When you have clean records in excellent shape and a system capable of doing something with the extra high frequencies it can pass.  The Shure by virtue of it\\'s less pronounced high frequency voicing will sound better with less apparent surface noise when playing noisy records. The Shure is also going to collect a bit less dust from deep in the grooves since it doesn\\'t go as deep where the real trash collects.  I\\'ve noticed the slightly narrower stylus on the AT311EP tends to collect way more stuff from old neglected records because it goes deeper in grooves where dust is next to impossible to remove with traditional record cleaning pads and carbon fiber brushes.  I can\\'t get to some of that dust and gunk on used records from a second-hand store by using a Discwasher pad cleaner but the AT311EP stylus sure can.  When you have an excellent to near mint clean groove you can turn the treble up and the AT will sound far more airy without surface noise or distortion.\\n\\nI think the low distortion on the highs is a real strong point of the AT311EP.  It isn\\'t brittle, it is clean.  I put on a really good copy of a very good recording (\"What\\'s New\" by Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle) and heard detail I frankly had never heard before with the Shure M92E.  On the other hand I put on a used bargain bin copy of an old Dells LP and even though I cleaned it best I could with the Discwasher and a carbon fiber brush the AT stylus collected so much stuff from deep in the groove I had to stop playing each side to clean off the dust clogged stylus and then resume play numerous times.\\n\\nBoth the AT311EP and Shure M92E are very light tracking cartridges with an optimum of 1 to 1.25 grams.  Neither should ever be used at more than 1.5 grams. The 1kH 29dB channel separation specs on the AT311EP are far better than the 1kH 20dB spec on the Shure M92E and darn close to the Grado Black\\'s 30dB.  The channel balance specs on the AT311EP are slightly better than the M92E also, by 0.75 dB. The AT311EP uses a .1 mil narrower stylus so it goes a wee bit deeper into the groove than the Shure M92E which accounts for both some of the added brightness and turning it into a better dust collector on old neglected records.  The Shure has the advantage of a lower cost stylus replacement because the ATN3472SE stylus used in the AT311EP is harder to make since it is slightly narrower and because the AT\\'s are imported from Japan.  Both the Shure and AT styli are diamond, thus about equally durable but the AT replacement is going to cost you more and stylus replacement cost matters to some people.  If you play a LOT of records or just like changing your stylus every few hundred hours then the Shure might be a money saver in the long run, but if you have a system capable of true fidelity the Shure simply is not as airy on the high end of the audio spectrum.\\n\\nIn an affordable P-Mount cartridge the AT311EP and the Shure M92E are the ones to consider right now for under $50.  Of the two the AT311EP sounds much better to me.  So P-Mount choices have narrowed dramatically in the past few years with most of the better P-Mount cartridges already gone and this midline AT311EP apparently barely escaping death. I love my old linear tracking turntable that uses P-Mount cartridges and this AT cartridge makes it sound way better to me. While it isn\\'t the best in the world it beats the Shure in the high frequencies and for under $75 the AT311EP is the best P-Mount left that I know about.  I am perfectly happy with it when playing clean records in good shape but not as happy with older worn records.  This AT cartridge is not very forgiving at all.  Wear and scratches are going to be very apparent.  If it has a fault, it is clarity.\\n\\nIf you have a good stereo with a decent P-Mount turntable that tracks at 1.5 grams down to 1.0 gram with a record collection in above average shape this AT is possibly the best and brightest P-Mount elliptical cartridge left at under $70 for you.  If you have a system that doesn\\'t pass much over 15k Hertz or records in less than ideal shape the Shure would be fine because you probably would not hear anything over 18k Hertz from your system anyway.\\n\\nEven though this AT311EP, the Shure M92E plus other AT cartridges are touted as \"Universal Mount\" and come with components included to adapt them to a traditional half-inch headshell mount, I would never suggest any P-Mount (T4P) cartridge for anything but a P-Mount tonearm.  There are better half-inch cartridges available for around the same money or just a bit more that are easier to setup on a half-inch mount headshell. The adapter components included with the \"universal\" cartridges add weight that frequently is hard to compensate for to get the tracking down to the 1.5 gram maximum and also add height that can cause setup complications such as an off tracking angle requiring shimming of the front mounting of the cartridge plus there can be azimuth angle compensation issues.  Mounting a half-inch cartridge is hard enough, don\\'t make it harder by using a \"universal\" mount cartridge.\\n\\nThe lone surviving Shure P-Mount cartridge is a fair cartridge and I\\'ve used it before, but it is not as airy as the AT311EP.  I gave the AT311EP 5 stars because while there were better P-Mount cartridges available at a sane price there now are not any better ones.  So a 4 star cartridge by default becomes 5 star in absence of the better models that are gone. The next step up is the Grado Black and for the casual non-audiophile listener like me with consumer grade components, while very nice, a Grado would be overkill.  The AT311EP is a steal right now costing less than dinner and a movie.  Unless you spend $75 you just can\\'t do any better in a P-Mount than this.', 'Like it very much, perfect fit & nice sound.', 'Well it took me about 31 years to replace the cartridge on my Technics Q200.\\nWas worried that the set screw hole might be a different size and in fact its not a perfect fit , but one of the supplied screws does allow the cartridge to be mounted .\\nGood news is that the AT311 sounds very  good .\\nThere was an empire brand cartridge in the unit but it is no longer manufactured.\\nDelivery was quick.', 'Exactly what I needed to replace the cartridge in my vintage Technics SL-B200 record player.

They're light weight and the cups are small. The sound quality is ABSOLUTELY good enough to monitor yourself playing as you record.

I use them for recording and they put out a pretty hot signal.

Put it in a Marantz 6300, installed it in the bedroom, and got some great new records.  At first I was a little disappointed with the sound.  It was a bit thin.  I thought that the Pickering might have aged out and perhaps the internals had dried up, hardened or softened just sitting in the case for all those years. Tried several receivers with good phono preamps but the results varied little.  Dug out some vintage external preamps but was still not delighted.  I finally got the Shure SFG-2 Tracking Force Gauge.  That was the missing link in my meticulous setup.  I've had some fine cartridges over the years, but few had the little brush attachment. Never felt the need for a brush.  I take good care of my records.  They are clean and static free.  But despite my best efforts, I quickly learned how notoriously inaccurate the calibration of even a good tonearm can be if you don't have a proper way to measure the tracking force.  Turned out the extra gram I thought I had added per the manufacturers spec to compensate for the brush was not even close.  So I used the guage, got a good reference for the stylus, added the extra gram, checked again and now I'm blasting Miles Davis Jack Johnson.  It's full, bright, has a nice throbbing bottom end.  No skips, no rumble.  A world of difference and I owe it all to getting the tracking dialed in with the help of this sweet little gauge.  Talk about money well spent!  Now I'll be setting up my Technics SL-1200 MK2 with a Stanton 681EEE downstairs in my studio.  I use that table more and I think it is pretty well balanced, but soon I will know for certain.

The pickup pattern is tighter and the frequency response is fuller. It probably has the ability to handle a higher sound pressure level also, but most won't care about that.\\n\\nThe pickup pattern is so tight that you will usually want to be within an inch of the windscreen, but this is why you won't get feedback as easily from it. Well, you know how you have to work the mic to adjust for louder and softer, now you'll just be working it at a closer distance, just remember to roll off the lows to reduce the proximity effect. But this is probably just it's biggest benefit of many, although it also makes it a bad choice for using one mic in front of three singers.\\n\\nThis microphone speaks of quality and durability in your hand, it's solid and heavy. The handling noise is excellent for those of you using this as a hand held microphone, it's quiet. It's frequency response drops down to 40Hz, making it an excellent choice for an instrument mic also. This will do a good job on close up work with guitar cabs to brass, providing excellent rejection of other sounds, The bottom of a snare or anyplace that you want a high rejection ratio, and can also fit this size of microphone.\\n\\nSo for those of you looking for it double as a recording microphone, because where you are recording has a high noise floor, it will work out well also. Being a studio owner, I suggest the quietest possible place to record and a low noise floor, but I know that it's not always possible. It will do a great job of rejecting other sound and focusing on what it's in front of.\\n\\nYou'll get a good clip and an average carry bag with it.\\n\\nIt's a good, high quality microphone at a fairly low price, and I can recommend it.\", \"I bought this to use for a series of video interviews but found it to fall far below my expectations.  I have been an avid Audio-Technica user for years and love their pro microphones.  I was hoping this would be similar in quality but my results were mixed.\\n\\nFirst of all, the sound quality from the microphone itself is fantastic for the price.  It is clear and crisp without being too bright.  It sounds far better than I expected for a microphone of this price.\\n\\nHowever, the output level of it is very low and makes it pretty much worthless.  I tried to use it four different ways and found only one of them to be usable, though it still sounded bad.\\n\\nThe first way was plugged directly into a camcorder.  It sounded great for about a minute or two but then the sound would fade out and for the rest of the recording, there was nothing but silence.  I attribute this more to the camcorder and not the mic since I have had other weird sound issues with other external sources on that camera.\\n\\nThe second way was on a different camera.  That camera has some sort of automatic gain control that boosted the mic up so loud that it was actually distorted the sound on the loud parts while bringing up the noise floor of the whole thing to about -18dbfs.  Obviously, this wasn't working the way I wanted it to.\\n\\nI then plugged it into the mic jack on my laptop and recorded the sound straight into the computer.  This was the only useful way that I found it would work but, because of the low output level, there was a lot of noise in the recording when boosting it to a normal level.  The background noise using this method came out to be around -26dbfs.  Though still pretty poor sounding, this would be usable.\\n\\nThe fourth way I tried it was my connecting it to an XLR adapter and plugging it into a pro mic preamp.  Again, the output was far too low and I got as much noise as I did usable signal.\\n\\nIn summary, if you have a camera that will match to the output level of this mic, you will get good sound.  However, I wouldn't hold out much hope that many cameras will meet that expectation.  Of course, at less than $20, you can probably afford to give it a shot.  I am giving it three stars mainly for the sound quality and the chance that I may eventually find a way to use it effectively.\", 'Own several great mic', 'I love mine, sounds amazing & the price is a must!', 'Having used the e835 in the studio and on-stage, I can say with absolute confidence and correctness that the e835 is a great mic and not \"muddy and congested\" as another review would attest.

In vocal mode, I have singed normal, loud and louder and it feels like it has a deep response, like if someone was pulling the mic back so that it does the vocals don't hit the bottom. in other words, this type of quality mic, will be able to handle louder volumes and louder sinnging, with out a popin sound and feeling like when you sing without a microphone.

I found that the video and the audio was slightly out of sync.  That could be just the way my camera and the computer interacted, but with a quick fix in the video editing software I was using, it was no problem.\\n\\nI like the small size of the microphone and clip.

If you don't know what this already is, I can't help you.\", 'I was expecting an exact Shure replacement, but received a generic stylus.  JIm Tavegia', \"I had to replace my 15 year old needle on my turntable. I had a Shure RX3P cartridge on it, so I went looking for a replacement. This model is it. And it fit perfectly, and plays my old records with decent sound reproduction. I have old 70s Panny speakers, since I didn't have the room for the big Technics when we moved (Those are being enjoyed by a friend). So i cut the RCA plugs off of them and stuck the wires into the back of my old Sony reciever and they work.\\n\\nAnyway, back to the needle. This fit in perfectly to my RX3P cartridge. As soon as it was installed, I went thumbing thru my record bins to figure out what to play, and decided on a couple Moody Blues LPs. They sounded fantastic. I'm so glad I can play my records again.\\n\\nEdit: I ended up recording some albums on my Sony ICD digital recorder I bought here (love it!) to put on cd. This needle really does the trick, especialy thru my Sony amplifier. Of course, I had to fix the speed digitally, and tweak some pops & clicks in my computer recording software, but still worth the extra work needed.\", 'This is a good all around cartridge especially if your not after a superior sound. It\\'s very \"neutral\" and uncolored which is a real plus. However, upper frequencies-cymbals, \"s\\'s\" etc.-can sometimes get muddy depending on the recording. Don\\'t let this scare you. This cart will track almost anything! If you can find a Shure 104E stylus to replace the stock stylus you\\'ll be pleasantly surprised at how good the 92E cartridge really sounds! I only give it 4 stars because the stock stylus is a little lacking on the high end, at least to my ear anyway! Good overall value especially given that it\\'s a \"universal\" mounting  system.\\n\\n10+Year Follow up (10-18-15)-Dusted off a back up Technics p-mount table while my main one\\'s being serviced. Installed a new belt and picked up 2 new carts (a Shure M92E and an Audio Technica AT 92E)  for a comparison while the Big Dog\\'s away. Played each with their stock stylus for about 10 hours before listening. Tough call as to which one sounds better to my ear. The AT definately has more upper frequency detail BUT the Shure sounds more \"full, balanced and warmer.\" In my opinion, the Shure produces more of that \"classic vinyl sound\" than the AT. Choose whichever \"flavor\" suits you best. You won\\'t go wrong either way. A good preamp helps. BTW, each cart\\'s stock stylus can be easily upgraded. FYI, replaced the stock Shure .4 X .7 elliptical stylus with a JICO .3 X .7 elliptical, 776 DEX. Still sounds warm and full but with much more detail and \"authority.\"\\n\\n12-5-15 Update. Upgraded the stylus on my Shure M97 XE with an after market hyper elliptical - great improvement!  Took the newly \"spare\"  M97 XE stylus and installed it on the M92E running on a p-mount table. It weighed about 1.25 grams more than the p-mount tracking standard of 1.25 grams. Didn\\'t want to increase the tonearm mass by adding weight behind the pivot point. So, I carefully removed the 97XE\\'s stabilizer brush assembly from the stylus assembly with a utility knife then reinstalled it. However, it now weighed in a bit under 1.25 grams. Added a small blob of Blu Tack on the top of the cart to correct the tracking force weight, molded it to conform then painted it black. What a sonic improvement! Best sounding \"M92E\" yet!! GEEK OUT!', \"I had this Shure cartridge when it first made it's debut. I'm gonna be nice and say that unless you have real old records, worn out records, the stuff you would never play on high end expensive equipment, then this cartridge is your answer ! If you use this on pristine records you will definitely hear the shortcomings of this cart with regards to tonal, frequency, and sibilant accuracy. It's not going to perform anywhere near Shure's other two high end audiophile carts with regards to tracking and overall clarity and sound quality...You really get what you pay for with the\\n\\nShure M92E. It does it's job well and I recommend it for casual background music listening only...It's not a DJ quality cart and it's not even anywhere near audiophile grade quality...it's just a dependable performer for those on an extremely tight budget.\", 'I use this on my amateur horror movies.

I use them into a small digital handheld recorder. Place a few of them around for great sound for your videos.. Excellent mic for the price.

I placed it on a tripod and let the digital recorder run all game while I shot video from the sidelines. I suppose it was maybe 70\\' from the loudspeaker. It made EXCELLENT mix sound for the football game. Just the right ammount of crowd ambiance and distance from the pole speaker.\\nVery, very pleased.', \"I've had this mic for almost two years.  In that time it has only left my home occasionally.  It always sits attached to my camera mount because I use it to make how-to videos at home.  It's never been abused in any way.  Today I went to use it and it was simply dead.  I tried a fresh battery and nothing.  It isn't a bad connection or a loose wire, it's just that some component on this thing's circuit card pooped out.  I have never in all my years of music and video production had a mic die this way.  Shame on Audio Technica for putting this piece of junk on the market.  BTW, I have another AT mic that I've had since 1981 and it still works.  My how times have changed.  It gets two stars simply because it sounded good when it did work.\", 'I\\'ve used sennheiser \"big\" shotgun mics (needing 48V phantom power and XLR connections) that are in the $700 price range and I was pleasantly surprised that the ATR-55 gave reasonable performance for the price.  You don\\'t compare it to a 2 foot long mic that costs 15x as much and is clearly for professional use.  It\\'s meant for the home moviemaker who is unhappy with the builtin mic on their camcorder which has an external 1/8\" mono mic jack  -- yes, this is a MONO output so it will likely only appear on one of two channels if you put it in a stereo mic jack leaving the other one empty.  You might want to build or buy a dual mono to a single stereo adapter so you can capture audio from 2 mic sources on tape when using this.  It will give you more editing options later when you read your tape + 2 audio tracks into your software.\\n\\nWhat it does best is replace that built in microphone on your DV handheld recorder that picks up the motor noise and every click of the buttons you press.  It does tend to reject your voice if you whisper to the person next to you, perhaps to adjust the lighting.  The package comes with two mic holders, one for a hot-shoe (no electrical connections) and one for a traditional mic stand/arm.  AT made a complete kit out of this unit.\\n\\nIt uses a single AA battery which should last for a long time.  Some advice - toss the included battery in your pile and buy a good one that won\\'t leak.  I recommend the L91 lithium AA batteries because of their long life and long storage without leakage.  This is a battery you won\\'t be replacing for a couple years so it\\'s best to put a high quality one in to begin with since you\\'ll forget it.  The L91 also provides about 2x the usage of a normal alkaline battery, but it costs ~2x as much so it works out in the end as a wash.\\n\\nOne note - the picture shows a nice metal mini 1/8->1/4 adapter but what is included in the kit is plastic and lacks the screw-on threads to keep it from pulling out.  The cable is fixed to the microphone and not replacable like professional equipment, but again it\\'s not at that price point.\\n\\nUse this and your videos will sound alot better.  The next step up is a wireless mic and receiver package for really long distances.  I have used several of these and they make for excellent tapes of a single subject willing to wear the mic and transmitter.  With the shotgun mic you are ready to go no matter who or what you are recording.\\n\\nI think you\\'ll be impressed with what you get for your money here.', \"The Azden transmitter-receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews. As an aspiring video maker it was a product I should have bought a long time ago.\\n\\nMine is the 9v-powered model, not the AA. But it has proven well-made, light and easy to use.\\n\\nThere's something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit. I find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping.\\n\\nBeing able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience. Another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise.

On a friend's recommendation I bought a can of this and put the TINIEST amount into the fader, moving it around.  The faders became fresh and movable, almost immediately!

It\\'s very \"neutral\" and uncolored which is a real plus. However, upper frequencies-cymbals, \"s\\'s\" etc.-can sometimes get muddy depending on the recording. Don\\'t let this scare you. This cart will track almost anything! If you can find a Shure 104E stylus to replace the stock stylus you\\'ll be pleasantly surprised at how good the 92E cartridge really sounds! I only give it 4 stars because the stock stylus is a little lacking on the high end, at least to my ear anyway! Good overall value especially given that it\\'s a \"universal\" mounting  system.\\n\\n10+Year Follow up (10-18-15)-Dusted off a back up Technics p-mount table while my main one\\'s being serviced. Installed a new belt and picked up 2 new carts (a Shure M92E and an Audio Technica AT 92E)  for a comparison while the Big Dog\\'s away. Played each with their stock stylus for about 10 hours before listening. Tough call as to which one sounds better to my ear. The AT definately has more upper frequency detail BUT the Shure sounds more \"full, balanced and warmer.\" In my opinion, the Shure produces more of that \"classic vinyl sound\" than the AT. Choose whichever \"flavor\" suits you best. You won\\'t go wrong either way. A good preamp helps. BTW, each cart\\'s stock stylus can be easily upgraded. FYI, replaced the stock Shure .4 X .7 elliptical stylus with a JICO .3 X .7 elliptical, 776 DEX. Still sounds warm and full but with much more detail and \"authority.\"\\n\\n12-5-15 Update. Upgraded the stylus on my Shure M97 XE with an after market hyper elliptical - great improvement!  Took the newly \"spare\"  M97 XE stylus and installed it on the M92E running on a p-mount table. It weighed about 1.25 grams more than the p-mount tracking standard of 1.25 grams. Didn\\'t want to increase the tonearm mass by adding weight behind the pivot point. So, I carefully removed the 97XE\\'s stabilizer brush assembly from the stylus assembly with a utility knife then reinstalled it. However, it now weighed in a bit under 1.25 grams. Added a small blob of Blu Tack on the top of the cart to correct the tracking force weight, molded it to conform then painted it black. What a sonic improvement! Best sounding \"M92E\" yet!! GEEK OUT!', \"I had this Shure cartridge when it first made it's debut. I'm gonna be nice and say that unless you have real old records, worn out records, the stuff you would never play on high end expensive equipment, then this cartridge is your answer ! If you use this on pristine records you will definitely hear the shortcomings of this cart with regards to tonal, frequency, and sibilant accuracy. It's not going to perform anywhere near Shure's other two high end audiophile carts with regards to tracking and overall clarity and sound quality...You really get what you pay for with the\\n\\nShure M92E.

I use a magnifier to inspect my needles for wear and my old ones were not even in need of repair but I picked these up anyway for the price. I immediately compared them to the old ones to verify there was no wear on the older ones but I replaced them anyway because I did the \"break in\" procedure on my old needles which caused the shafts to develop kinks in them. I don\\'t know if it had any impact on sound quality (especially for DVS), but for the price, I figured why not. I\\'m primarily an Ortofon user but these are great for DVS use and general playback, the needles are also cheaper to replace.

Right now my shop is closed up but I am getting back into the groove of things and ready to DJ again and again. I never leave for a gig without these in case there will be a throw down of DJ skills to pay da bills.

It is usually 48V @ 7mA which is active on the cable that connects the microphone to the amplifier.  I suspect it is called \"Phantom\" power, because there is no indication that it is there, except that a condenser microphone won\\'t work without it.  Sometimes, a condenser microphone will have its own power source, usually a battery, to provide the electrical power for the microphone circuitry.\\n\\nWhen considering microphone choices, two rules come to mind.\\n\\n\"Dynamic\" microphones, do not, and cannot use \"phantom\" power.  If you connect a dynamic microphone to a microphone port that provides phantom power, you will have a broken dynamic microphone.  Sometimes there is a switch to turn off any phantom power.\\n\\n\"Condenser\" microphones, on the other hand, DO REQUIRE phantom power and usually cost more than dynamic microphones, because they have internal electronics that require a power source, i.e. Phantom Power.\\n\\nEven though it does not mention the microphone type, based on the price alone, I can tell you that this is probably a dynamic type microphone and if it sounds terrible at 8 bucks, then it probably sounds like a cheap microphone.', \"I bought a couple of different low cost microphones from different companies and I have to say that They didn't do a good job on this model.  the sound is ok however, there is more feedback than most, and the cable is extemely thin.

The out-of-box action (string height) is good and can be played \"as is.\"  For a better experience, it should be taken to a guitar shop and adjusted (set up) properly.  Action is adjusted by raising or lowering the neck or bridge nut, not by adjusting the truss rod - as many people attempt to do.\\n\\nAs to the sound, it\\'s great!  A 3/4 scale guitar is not going to project loud, but it\\'s tone is very pleasing.  I would recommend getting light strings (11-47 or thinner) for a beginner.  The guitar stays in tune well, I have not had a problem with the tuners as others have claimed.  The neck and frets are first class.  The size is perfect for a child.  All in all this guitar is great.  For the money, or even for several hundreds more, you will not find a better guitar.  I highly recommend it.', 'I borrowed my friends guitar in order to get my nephew to play.  It is junk.  With new strings, it still sounds lousy.  The tuning machines are poor quality, one of the pegs keeps popping out, and the action is lousy (like any guitar comes out of the box unfortunately).  I have had several guitars.  While it is possible to buy a $130 guitar that is o-kaaay, you still need a luthier to set it up.  In my opinion you get what you pay for and there is a reason that Martins and Gibsons cost over $2000 for a decent instrument.  That aside, for kids starting out I would avoid this piece of junk and get something better, even an Epiphone maybe.', 'I have been playing guitar for over 40 years, and have owned a JR1.  Mine did need to be intonated but otherwise sounded okay for the size.  Also I\\'d definitely recommend a string change, but then I change strings on most of my guitars when I buy them.  I did feel that using either Martin Silk and Steel or DR Rare phosphor bronze strings improved the tone of this little guitar and made it sound pretty good.  It\\'s small, probably small enough to fit in overhead storage, but my 6\\' 7\" husband played it regularly with no problem, and although I prefer a wider neck, I also had no problem with this guitar.  The coolest thing - since it is priced so low, I have no problem leaving it out on a stand or playing it on the porch or anywhere.\\n\\nVery handy little guitar, definitely not a toy.  Good guitar if you need something small or inexpensive, or both.', 'Who says you have to spend an x amount of hundreds even thousands of dollars on a phono cartridge to listen to crisp and detailed vinyl/analog playback ? However, words like crisp and detailed are very meager adjectives to describe the musical sonic characteristics of this cartridge (true, the rest of your component system\\'s own sound characteristics come into play, i.e; receiver,amp,pre-amp,turntable,speakers).If any part of your audio system does not have that \"synergy\", then you may notice either slight, miniscule shortcomings from the cartridge or system or both. For those with already a warm or neutral sounding system will be dramatically surprised and awestruck. For those who have just the opposite type of system and also may have an eq inline, you may want to adjust your treble settings. The AT 440ML is NOT a neutral or \"warm\" sounding cartridge---far from it. The upper mids and highs will possibly have your dog running out of the room. It\\'s not bass shy either. Bass is firm  but never muddy or boomy. It reproduces the lows and highs very well. There are no punchy mids (though the mids are reproduced admirably but not accurately). Some critics have said this cartridge out of the box and installed properly is reminiscent of having an inline equalizer and it\\'s frequency knob controls in the \"v\" formation. Stereo channel separation is probably the best these ears have heard over any other stereo cartridge I have had in the past (from the Grado Prestige Series to a couple of high-end Shure cartridges).There is definitely a 3-dimensional sonic imaging characteristic in the AT 440ML (especially noted with acoustic and jazz music). The Audio Technica beats most other hi end named brands to the punch with such wide stereo stage channel separation. I have closed my eyes with headphones on or with speakers and I always hear and experience the \"you are there\" feeling that makes me appreciate records much more than the cold 2-dimensional flat sound of audio cd\\'s. Female vocals have a soft but clear presence. Male vocals are well reproduced. The micro-linear stylus reaches deep into the grooves without carving the vinyl (YES ! a wonderful light tracker that requires anywhere from .8 to 1.6 g of tracking force).This will cut down on the wear and tear of your vinyl collection as well as your cartridge/stylus...\\n\\nDoes this mean that the AT 440ML is PERFECT and that you have finally reached analog playback nirvana??? Well, that depends on different viewpoints. If you have bought cheap cartridges all your life in the $20 to $40 range, then this AT 440ML will be an audio revelation that will have you realize what you have been missing all this time. BUT, it\\'s only a taste of the high end, audiophile analog world. If you have had other hi-end name brand cartridges (an experienced audiophile) and have paid more than what this cartridge is going for, then from a monetary stance you may have paid too much---that is IF the AT\\'s sound rivals or is reminiscent of those pricier carts. On the other hand, if you prefer the warm, neutral sound to your liking, and possibly don\\'t want to experience ear and mind fatigue from a bright cartridge then do not buy this cartridge. The AT 440 ML is a colored (soundwise) cartridge. You will only become ear fatigued if you are used to more neutral or warm cartridges (this is where you will need to adjust your treble settings). As with most cartridges, the AT 440 ML does require a little bit of \"breaking-in\" period (some say 30 hours to maybe 50---depending on your playback time habits). I have owned the AT 440ML for over a year now and it does get more looser or liquid-like, smooth and sweeter in sound(but not warm or dull) with no harsh or grainy sonic characteristics (sounds like I\\'m describing a fine liquor or malt shake).\\n\\nThe last glaring question (probably one of the most important) is whether or not this is an excellent tracker (and this is a two-fold question or concern). Are words beginning with s, t, p, and f accurately reproduced (sibilance)? Yes and no. That honorary distinction would be for the Shure V15VxMR cartridge (which is now out of production and was the last of a dying audiophile cartridge breed to be had for a reasonable price range). With the AT 440ML it\\'s more hit than miss with sibilants. About 85% to 90% of the time \"spitty\" consonants are pronounced accurately with a slight edge or exaggeration. However, there have been a few of my clean records where the letter \"s\" cuts through with that static-like harshness more than once on any given side. One such record I have that proves this theory and shortcoming of this cartridge is  Joe Jackson\\'s Jumpin\\' Jive swing jazz album (the letter s is tracked harshly with that annoying edgy sound). As for overall tracking quality of the music signal in general from beginning of groove to end, it has that inner groove distortion problem licked (this is where the AT 440ML shows off it\\'s greatest audiophile strength). This is due to the linear contact stylus. Nothing MORE aggravating to a record listener than when a low budget or poorly produced cartridge, while it may sound clear and great in the first few tracks on a record side, but then as the needle goes towards the center, the last tracks suffer horribly (no matter how much anti-skate force you apply)! You will no longer have this problem with the AT 440ML; you will finally find out what you have been missing.\\n\\nKeep in mind that this deep-groove tracing microlinear stylus by design,in picking up such fine musical detail, will also pick up record surface noise and dirt;That\\'s right, that snap,crackle, and pop from static,dirt, or lint. Majority of micro-linear cartridges will do that as opposed to conical or elliptical styli that sort of tend to almost try to soften,mask or even blend out surface record noise.  Conical or elliptical styli,with their larger \"footprint\" tip, will push dirt and other debris out of the way on the record\\'s surface. They also do not reach deep into the groove and make that much of an accurate contact with the groove\\'s wall as a microlinear stylus does. The microlinear stylus will reach deeper into the groove where there is more accumulated dirt or debris;it\\'s a fact(being a light tracker however, this will not wear out your records as fast as a regular stylus cartrdige would). So, I also recommend using an anti-static brush on those not so pristine records. This is the only other area where maybe it\\'s competitor ,the Shure M97xE cartridge, might come out a little ahead; Shures are well known and admired for their almost quiet record surface noise playback and background !\\n\\nThe bottom line, with both thumbs highly up, I absolutely recommend this fine cartridge. Period. Especially for a novice to the vinyl world or someone on a budget. I have found it difficult to listen to cd\\'s or any digital musical format since owning this cartridge. In fact, I get bored with cd playback nowadays. There\\'s just no musical \"involvement\".Don\\'t be fooled by the simple black and lavender/purple? colored simple looking cartridge. It\\'s what\\'s on the inside of the body that really counts ! The AT 440ML possesses that bang for the buck quality that is hard to beat and will revitalize your long yearning for super (not perfect) audiophile listening and extract nuances and other fine qualities from your record collection !', \"outperforms any cartridge in its price range, I think what most people say about brightness might be because they are not accustomed to less detailed media, I don't think a cartridge can add content that is not there in the music, you can always correct with eq, I personally don't need to use any equalization on my electrostatic speakers. It is brighter than other cartridges but I think that's just the way it should be.\", 'Excellent cartridge at any price but superb at its price point. The line contact stylus reduces record wear because of the longer contact area while narrowing the tracing radius which improve high frequency response. Compared to the excellent Shure m97xe, the AT has a more open sound with faster transients than the Shure which provides a very smooth warmer sound with less hi frequency extension.', 'This product has been a real pleasure to use and it tracks very well. I have the older model with a sabata and it performs just as well . The bottom is smooth and the highs are accurate l use a pro-jet phono preamp and it another 20 db.  boost , my recordings to cd sound great. The cost was a little high but the 140 gives my denon 110 mc a run for the money.  Good recording.  Mph from long beach', 'I am really enjoying this 440MLa. It is very revealing and a good match for my vintage Sony PS-LX5, which isn\\'t a high-end table by any means but has a decent tonearm. I do notice that unless I have a very clean pressing, there are more ticks from surface noise than with other cartridges. When I record an LP for home network streaming, I sometimes switch to my Denon DL-110, since it is less likely to make surface noise apparent. For overall detail, though, the AT 440MLa is hard to beat and the pricing through an Amazon reseller was the best I found anywhere. AT cartridges are also not fussy about cable capacitance (\"loading\"), unlike some cartridges such as the better Shures and a few others. If your tonearm can handle a high compliance cartridge, I highly recommend this. You can get replacement styli, too, unlike some of the more esoteric moving-coil designs which are very pricey. Having heard supposedly \"better\" moving-coil designs, I prefer the AT. I track it at 1.4G and the microline stylus is superb, especially on inner-groove tracking. Very revealing, though, so you will want to have a good regimen for cleaning your records!', 'I was hesitant and couldn\\'t decide between this and Shure\\'s cartridge.. Then  l read a lot of people said that this particular cartridge is bright and I know for sure Shure is warmer (i\\'ve owned one before). 440mla has a more detailed sound according to many videos and samples I\\'ve heard and since my speakers tend to give out warm sound anyways, I figure I should get this \"bright\" cartridge (knowing that it will be toned down by the warmth of my speakers) and it happened, beautifully.. just right!\\n\\nI\\'m loving the fullness, spaciousness, and somewhat warm but detailed sound of this cartridge. It did not come out as bright as other people have said.. Man, this one cost as much as a piece of a new turntable, but it\\'s worth every penny. Save up and get this one, you won\\'t be sorry.\\n\\n*if your speaker tends to be bright, I will warn you when getting this cartridge as it may sound bright, but not everyone dislike the brightness this cartridge has produced, so just make sure you do your research and listen to as many samples as you need. You will be very happy with this cartridge, I know I do.', \"I have yet to install this, but please read reviews of it anywhere, and you will learn that, at this price point, you will be hard pressed to find a cart & stylus to even match this one. Due to the delicate nature of the wire on my TT, i am taking mine to a tech to get it installed, then i will do the alignment, unless the tech provides that as well. This is a Superior Cart, with a top shelf Stylus. If you want your vinyl to SING at its best, you won't beat this cart in quality craftsmanship, especially without spending $500+, and that plus can go well over $1,200. This cart has hovered between $190-$250, and it is a value at either price. Still that range lets you know it can be found at a lower price, but make sure, in that case that it is still new and unused.\", \"Ahh!  At last no IGD aka Inner Groove Distortion.  I kicked a Ortofon 2M Red to the curb because it seemed like the last 5 minutes of most EP/LP's were too distorted to enjoy.\\n\\nBased on other reviews and recommendations I switched to this.  No more IGD as mentioned.\\n\\nI have now used this on a Project Carbon (former 2m Red), MusicHall MMF 7.1 and Technics 1210M5G all with great success.\", \"The enthusiastic reviews here may possibly represent a type of listener, instead of the cartridge's performance. In actual comparison with several cartridges at this price level AND higher, this cartridge invariably shows up unnaturally bright and fatiguing.\\nIts generous tracking ability and freedom from sibilance is a virtue shared with several competitors also.\\nBUT one competitor shares the great tracking ability together with the nice look of quality manufacturing, more natural (and non-fatiguing) treble, AND substantially lower price. The Denon DL-110 delivers more natural tone and staging, including generous tracking and freedom from the irritating treble tone of this Audio Technica cartridge. The DL-110 is a better performer for a lower price.\", 'I purchased this cartridge for the same reasons many others here did- I was having fits trying to deal with inner groove distortion on used vinyl purchases that I\\'ve been ripping to ProTools as 24/96 wav\\'s and DVD-Audio discs. My set up for this job is a Denon DP-45f turntable running straight through an amazing 1975 vintage Marantz 3600 preamp that\\'s been completely refurbished to original specs, then to the ProTools inputs with custom made Mogami cables by ProLA Audio. My previous (other) cartridge is a Denon DL110 high output moving coil (also purchased a few months ago for this labor of love)\\n\\nAfter a careful set up using the Hi Fi News test record, where this cartridge tracked noticably better than the Denon, after about a dozen LP\\'s tracking at 1.7 grams (tho 1.4 is suggested, 1.8 is the max and this tested best for my set up), my observations are (positives 1st):\\n\\n1) This cartridge has noticably, and I mean NOTICABLY, better tracking ability. Inner groove distortion is all but eliminated on records that I had deemed un-rippable with the Denon cartridge.\\n\\n2) Surface noise is also noticably lower (over 7db measured through ProTools in A/B recordings of the same record passages between tracks). Pops and clicks are also diminished greatly-as a guestimate I\\'d say over a third to almost half, but that is truly subjective based on the damage done by previous playings on my particular used records.\\n\\nThe negatives (in relation to my other set up)\\n\\n1) The AT cartridge doesn\\'t sound as good as the Denon on prime vinyl. It has a smaller soundstage (less \"open air\" around the instruments). Also, The highs have a decidedly more metallic sound on cymbals and hi-hats, etc. Silibance issues are also more pronounced-not totally harsh but again more prominent than the Denon, which when the vinyl is worthy is a joyous listening experience. I\\'m sure this will lessen on the AT as I get another 50 hours or so on the cartridge, and even when the silibance is more pronounced there\\'s no truly annoying inner groove distortion to go with it.\\n\\n2) The AT cartridge is 50% more than the Denon.\\n\\nBut, to all but eliminate the nagging issue of having to buy 2 copies (or more) of certain records and even then, more often than not, not completely solving the IGD problem, I surely would have saved the price of the AT cartridge considering the 150 LP\\'s and counting I\\'ve done so far. The combination of the two cartridges for me solves an issue that was hindering the amazing amount of fun I\\'ve been having ever since I realized I\\'ve been lied to all along when they told me digital was better :-)\\n\\nMy only other \"issue\" is not with the cartridge, but with Amazon. They\\'ve been getting slack on \"fulfilling\" Prime orders when the item is from a third party vendor but \"in stock\". I had to again call customer service when this item didn\\'t show up as promised. (the second time in three months). The person was very friendly, saying there was an internal error with the processing. When I ordered a second one overnight just to make sure I\\'d get one in time for my listening party, she waved the additional shipping and Ok\\'d the return while I was on the phone-a nice gesture even if it is a mute one with the full refund upon return. They both showed up the next day.\\n\\nWith ALL that said, this is a great solution that I can not be happier that I discovered by research and reading other reviews on Amazon. I hope mine helps you make your choice-you won\\'t be disappointed. 5-stars!', \"Since Audio Technica have doubled the price in the last two years for the cart and the replacement tips, you simply get what you pay for: great performance at a relatively high price.  It is no longer the audiphile steal of the decade, and thus needs to be juxtaposed to its competition.\\n\\nFurthermore, it requires a very low mass tonearm to get the right resonance synergy due to the very high compliance and low downforce.  All Technics and most Rega arms, for instance, are mid-mass.\\n\\nFor a hundred bucks a replacement tip nowadays, you might as well get into mid-compliance moving coil designs, which by their very nature have extremely low effective tip mass due to there being only coils rather than heavier magnets on the cantilever end on the other side of the pivot inside.  You can't replace the stylus yourself on an MC, but you're practically paying the cost of a whole new cart on the 440MLa anyway at these prices.\\n\\nAs was also proven with the Shure V15 series before it, the diamond cut and cantilever material can be instrumental in giving a moving magnet/moving iron design low effective tip mass, but there is a diminishing return.  MC designs with such improvements are even lower tip mass.  If the price ever comes back down on the replacement tips to a reasonable price, then certainly snatch them up.  It's an incredible MM design.\", \"This is the 440MLa. An excellent sound, with plenty of clean, high frequency detail. I don't find it too bright, but there is lots of variation, depending on the record. Good records really show up nicely.  Much less tracking distortion that I'm used to and not the warm sound of the Grados, which I don't miss.  My only gripe is the low tracking force...1.4g means it is easy for clumsy people, like me, to bump the stylus out of the groove.\", 'As a non-audiophile, I was not sure that upgrading the Audio Technica cartridge that comes standard with the Audio-Technica PL120 Turntable would produce a noticeable improvement.

These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet.  It\\'s all about money to them.  I couldn\\'t believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics (even lower-priced several years ago) and insisting they were as good as Shure SM-57\\'s and 58\\'s.  I still don\\'t believe the quality of workmanship compares (any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much).  But these Nady\\'s handle the announcing, the vocals, and, when needed, the softer sounding instruments (flute, harmonica), and none has broken or quit on my watch.\\n\\nI\\'m a keyboardist, so mic power and fidelity don\\'t affect me.  I\\'m only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important \"gear component.\"  At the same time, my embarrassment, I confess, is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee.  After all, who\\'s playing--and getting paid for it?', 'I originally purchased this for my daughter for use as a second mic for her Karaoke machine.  Since then I have borrowed it for a back up vocalist in a band I have recently joined.  Today I am online to purchase two more to replace the \"professional\" mic\\'s supplied by another band member for the rest of the vocalists.  The other mics are nothing but feedback generators, and sound far too thin compared to this Nady.  This mic is not quite as responsive as my Shure SM58, but it\\'s close enough for live music, and the price just can\\'t be beat.  This mic is nice and hefty, and the quality of materials used in construction is very apparent.  Frankly, I don\\'t understand how anybody can really be profiting from building and shipping them for this price.  So far I haven\\'t had any issues with the supplied cable, but if the professional in you can\\'t tolerate the thought of singing through a 1/4\" jack, you can use it with an XLR cable purchased separately.  My only complaint is that it has a cheesy label wrapped around it just beneath the screen that absolutely screams \"karaoke mic\".  To summarize: If you can\\'t afford a $100 mic, skip everything between, and go straight for this one at ten bucks.', \"This thing worked the first time I plugged it in, but it hadn't worked since!

This cable works perfectly and is well made. Fine product, good price.', 'I use Guitar port exclusively for recording. I have been pleased with the results. The guitar amp modeling is decent but, I like the bass amp modeling a little better. Some of the guitar amps sound pretty good, some I don\\'t care for, for example the \"58 tweed B-man\" is supposed to sound like a 59 Fender Bassman. I own a 59 fender bassman and the software amp model doesn\\'t do the original any justice. I did add the fx and bass packs and have not regretted the additional purchase. The bass pack is very useful.\\n\\nThe amp, cabinet, enclosure, microphone, and fx models do a good job recreating the originals with some exceptions. For $100 dollars and a project studio this software is hard to beat. It has helped me numerous times when I wanted a certain sound for a song and can\\'t spend $$$ for a Marshall jcm 2000, mesa boogie dual rectifier, soldano slo 100, or a plethora of microphones. Also the pre-sets are good. Line 6 did an excellent job of recreating Eddie Van Halen\\'s sound from the early 80\\'s. But you can choose your amp, cainet, enclosure, mic, and fx combo and dial in your own settings specifically tailored to your desires quite easily. I did purchase the expansion Bass and FX packs. The bass cabinets and amps are very nice and the extra effects add quite a bit of room to create.\\n\\nI use this software on a PC running XP media center. I never had any problems installing, running, or updating the software. The only issue I\\'ve ever had with the software was a few years ago. I would plug in to play and all I would get was pure digital distortion every time I strummed my guitar strings. I did some research and discovered that there is a common issue with Guitar Port and my pc xbox 360 game controller working together. For some reason the software from the xbox controller interfered with the software from the guitar port. Before I installed the xbox controller the guitar port worked fine. So I uninstalled the xbox controller and now everything works fine again. This was about two years ago and I haven\\'t looked to see if Line 6 or Microsoft ever resolved the issue, but I leave the game playing to my xbox 360 now and the recording, mixing, and editing to my pc.\\n\\nI do recommend this product for recording studios. It has helped me achieve sounds that I otherwise would have had to spend thousands of dollars on microphones and amps to achieve.', \"The short version of this review: If you're a beginner I would not recommend this product. If you're an intermediate player approach with caution. If you're looking for a solid tool for home recording consider buying a nicer virtual instrument plug-in for your DAW or perhaps even a real Pocket POD before this thing. I am very disappointed in this product considering the other options.\\n\\nGuitarPort is marketed as being both a educational tool as well as professional recording tool, I will review both aspects separately. To use GuitarPort as an educational tool requires a monthly subscription fee to GuitarPort OnLine. The monthly fee is less than ten dollars and for that you get a fixed library of professionally recorded hit tracks from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, etc... For a given track you can download: without bass, without guitar or full mix. You can also download the guitar tab and tone settings. The tone settings will load the appropriate amp model, effects and then set up the amp and effects. You can hit the play and stop buttons and the tab will display on the screen. Sounds great right? Well, it is to a point.... The nice thing here is that you are downloading official tone settings and official tabs licensed by the publisher. The bad thing is that the tab playback software is pretty bad. It's just displaying a PDF on screen and scrolling as the track plays. If you've ever used a program like GuitarPro you will be very very disappointed in the TAB playback. Also the number of songs available is a problem. They aren't really updating their catalog. Lessons are OK at best (if the TAB playback where more like GuitarPro for features then the lessons would be much better, but it isn't). You might as well walk into a local music store and buy a book on playing, the lesson selections here (while some are very good) are not organized in a coherent way for a beginner. The product assumes the player knows what an effect box is, what the various settings on an amp does, etc... in short, it's not a beginners tool. Overall I would give this a grade C- as a learning tool. It has potential for intermediate players, but that's about it. There is another big problem with Guitar Port as an educational tool: NO BASS TABS are available through guitar port on-line and if you want the bass amp models and effects you will have to buy them on-line as an software upgrade for about fifty dollars! As a tool for bass guitarist, GuitarPort is useless.\\n\\nRegarding using GuitarPort for professional recording tool: When it comes to using software to simulate amps, rhythms, etc.. there are a few industry standards that make these sort of products compatible with a wide variety of DAW (digital audio workstation) recording software such as ProTools, Cakewalk, Ableton Live, etc..  the most popular standard is called VST. Line6 recently added GearBox VST as part of GuitarPort software package, so if you're looking to add Line6 POD quality models and effects for direct guitar studio recording, this is an inexpensive solution and really the only area in which Guitar Port shines (p.s. I still perfer the tone quality and features of Amplitube 2 for this sort of thing)\\n\\nOverall the GuitarPort a bit of a novelty product, it's not the amp models or effects are bad, it's just for about fifty dollars more you can pick up a PocketPOD and have all these great tones in a little battery powered, hand held device. You even hook the PocketPOD up to a PC using a USB cable and download the free software from Line6 to do almost everything you can with GuitarPort. I see a lot of positive reviews for this thing, so it seems it has made many people happy, but your money can be spent better elsewhere and if you are a beginner stay far away!\\n\\nOnly two stars for lack of coherence for the education/training this thing provides. GuitarPort on-line offers too little for what you get and absolutely zero bass guitar material in terms of tabs and lessons. Bass amp models (and a good number of PODxt models) require add on purchase here. You could easily spend $150 on add-ons before making the GuitarPort a viable studio VST instrument.

It boosts a fragile human voice into a strong one, if they make use of the proximity effect as a benefit, rather than a detriment, which is probably why Bono liked it, but since it's dynamic, you can get away with capturing sound in environments where a condenser mic would require sound proofing and special vibration isolating mic stands.  If you want to sound great over a PC in a noisy bar, on a noisy stage full of musicians, the proximity effect and cardioid pattern of this mic will make that happen, and it will do the same for getting a good recording in a room that isn't soundproof, with traffic outside, etc.  Is it the mic that's going to capture the sound of a spit bubble popping in your mouth or your sister's pet mouse farting?

If you need more sensitivity, go with a condenser mic.\\n- Solid construction.  Built like a more expensive mic.  Takes a beating and still sounds great.\\n- Price.  Just fantastic value.\\n- Response curve.  Fairly flat with 10 db drop-off from 200 to 50 hz.  Can be used to mic almost anything with a bit of eq tweaking.\\n\\nOther thoughts:\\n- I also like the even-more-affordable PG48, especially for a cheap bass guitar cabinet mic.

Also came with a good quality cable.', \"It is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isn't a Shure SM58. This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then I changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.\\n\\nHere's what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.\\n\\nI haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.\\n\\nI looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10K Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.\\n\\nI also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.\\n\\nI then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.\\n\\nI didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but I did reach some conclusions:\\nThere is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.\\n\\nI wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58.\", \"good mic for simple live stuff that isn't too expensive.  it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things\", 'Awesome quality, keep up the good work.', 'Perfect will buy again', \"Great sounding mic.

Pretty rugged and reliable, and the cable isn\\'t bad.\\n\\nNOTE: if you plan to plug this mic into a 1/4\" input make sure you get a transformer and not just an adapter.  XLR and 1/4\" inputs have a different impedance, without the transformer your gain (signal level) will be very low!', \"Just got this, have used it for recording and rehearsal, it works well so far and I will revise the review if that somehow changes in the next few years.

So while I didn't purchase it, it's been in my possession for the last three years, and it's been in use on a fairly consistent basis since.\\n\\nFirst of all, it is a Shure microphone. While technology is quickly closing the gap between inexpensive and expensive equipment, the one thing I can say about this microphone that I can't say about many (not all) other low-cost dynamic microphones is that it feels solid when it's held. If it falls to the floor I don't have to worry about it being damaged. Any Shure I've ever used has felt the same way.\\n\\nSecond, it is an entry level microphone. Don't expect the PG48 XLR to perform like Shure's more famous SM57 or SM58. While they may be the same brand, they certainly are not the same microphones. Shure is clear in their product description that the best uses for the PG48 XLR are for public address and karaoke performances. In my experience I've found this description to be accurate.\\n\\nThird, if you are looking for performance microphones at a low-cost, there are a couple I could easily recommend that, while they aren't Shure, will more than get the job done. As I mentioned previously technology is quickly closing the gap between brands like Shure to brands like Behringer. Since this is a review about the Shure PG48 XLR though, just ask me for my recommendations in the comment section.\\n\\nThe last thing I'll say is the PG48 XLR is a good entry level microphone regardless of who makes it. Given its proper setting and application it's more than adequate to make public announcements or to sing to a group of 50 or less. In such settings there's no need to go the more expensive route, even within the Shure family. Just don't expect to be able to play in a rock band with it, because it's not that kind of microphone.\", 'another great item especially for in-house', \"For those folks out there that just want a decent mic that sounds pretty darn good without breaking the bank, I don't see how you can go wrong with this mic.  For $40 don't expect recording quality but don't be afraid to buy this mic if you are just starting out and playing small gigs with a small budget. This mic is  professional quality compared to some I've used to sing through in the past. I'm using it now as a vocal mic in a small jam band playing in senior citizens centers and nursing homes.  Heck, I'm an old guy that doesn't play the joints anymore, playing with some other guys in the same situation, so I've been through a lot of mics in my experience.

But with respect to the Shure, I\\'m less sure that the SM58 isn\\'t worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and \"clean\" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).\\n\\nP.S.

When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it\\'s a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it\\'s the most popular microphone in the world.  For five bucks extra, I can\\'t fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch.  It\\'s a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of \"private\" comments by indiscreet band members.  And even if you\\'re an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57.  The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it\\'s also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.\\n\\n[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of \"this seller.\"  Perhaps a good point unless it\\'s in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns.

They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they\\'re getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility.

The sound created by you touching the microphone body, changing / adjusting your grip is clearly transmitted to the system as well, whereas the SM58 did not have this problem. I think a noise gate may help this problem but that's a pro PA item and most people don't even know what it is.\\nIt's built solid, like the other Shures.\\nThe main function for the PG48, like the other reviewer said, is to get abused by bad /crazy bands and you won't feel too bad.\", 'I\\'m a mobile DJ.

I personally would use them the regularly for back up vocals for there low cost and superior sound.\\n\\nbut some shows are very particle about having 58's. but these are the bands who know how to treat a mic.\\n\\nof course nothing beats a classic shure sm 58\", 'Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I\\'ve actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a \"Shure Model 545 Unidyne III.\"  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function.  I\\'ve owned or used countless modern day SM-58\\'s and SM-57\\'s along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don\\'t need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I\\'d only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58\\'s require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57\\'s.  I prefer the SM-57\\'s over the SM-58\\'s for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I\\'ve ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I\\'d recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I can\\'t find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you\\'ve ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I\\'d use an SM-7, which really doesn\\'t sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it\\'s predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.

The fake was very close, the counterfeiters are getting better and better even had the yellow and green wires and the indentation on the screen on top.

These models may have been very good decades ago, but they are really showing their age. The most prominent problem with them is the sound quality... they are quite \"honky,\" making vocalists sound much more nasal than they really are. There are some situations where that might be okay (such as miking a guitar cabinet that lacks upper mid-range), but these models do not make good vocal mics.\\n\\nIn a shootout in my studio with more than 20 different models of mics, the SM57/58 were near the bottom of the list. Virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better. And I\\'m not talking about comparing it to $3500 Neumann U87 mics either... more than half of the mics we used were under $150. Other, better choices in a similar price range are the AKG D5, Heil Sound PR 22, or stepping up to the Shure Beta 57, which is much, much better. And all of which have better off-axis rejection and higher gain before feedback.\\n\\nI know that nearly everyone uses these mics, but that doesn\\'t actually mean they are that good. There are much better choices for your money.\\n\\nOn the plus side, both the SM57 and SM58 are nearly bullet-proof.

(The Neuman KMS 105 might sound a bit better, at 6 times the price.  Then again, it might not!)  And the 57 is a surprisingly good performer for vocals in the studio.  I like my large diaphragm condensers for some things, but when I want to wail, the 57 is still among the best I've found.  Maybe THE best.  The special Shure A2Ws windscreen is the reason for my new appreciation of the 57.  With the windscreen in place, breath noise and plosives are gone (unless I get really sloppy).  I a/b'd the 57 with the windscreen against a Shure SM58.  The 58's a great mic, but the 57 sounds more open in the top end (as other reviewers have noted.)  Generic windscreens don't sound as good with this mic.  They tend to be too thick and dense, blocking a lot of the high frequencies.  Spend the $15 and get the A2WS.  It has a set screw that enables you to lock the screen in place, leaving a small air space between the foam and the mic's grill.  Gives it a nice, open, airy sound.  The 57's not a high output mic, so you'll need a bit more gain in the preamp compared to some mics, but that's a very minor drawback.\\n\\nFor mic-ing guitar amp cabinets, this is an industry standard.  Also good for snares, toms, even kick drums.  (Take the windscreen off for these applications, of course.)  It's probably the most versatile microphone ever made.

Criticisms:  Mic has a very short range and low gain.  When recording voice you need to hold very close to mouth.  When recording guitar you need to have the amp very loud.  In both cases you need to turn up the input gain on your recording device.\\n\\nHaving said that, this is a good sounding microphone that will give you years of ultra-reliable use.

This means they are absolutely fantastic for drums - it\\'s very easy to record multiple tracks with minimal \"bleeding\" coming through on other tracks. I mic all of my drums with these, except I use a Beta 52 for my bass drum, and currently I use lower-end overheads (these are the weak link in my setup). The SM57s aren\\'t fantastic for cymbals.\\n\\nI love how these mics give me a good clean base recording. Using my favorite DAW (Reaper) I can easily liven the sound up with my own reverbs and such. The SM57s will give you a great image; you just apply your own colors.\\n\\nI absolutely love hooking these up to my PA and playing live - since they reject much of the background noise, I can crank my PA up loud and it sounds very clear. Also, these are fairly good at rejecting feedback. When I mic my Marshall amp the guitar comes through incredibly loud and clear.

That being said, it sounds pretty much like junk\", \"I had at least $100 worth of fun assembling this kit.  First I exposed the parts to sunlight to deepen the grain in the wood.  After about a week the grain had deepened substantially. Then sanding, and a little more of a suntan.  Make up the neck joint, using rubber bands for camping.  I used hide glue, but didn't care for the joint, so steamed it apart and used good wood glue.  That made a much better joint.  More sanding, and masking for the saddle.  Glued on the fingerboard using rubber bands and pencils as clamps.\\nONe problem I had was getting the fattest string to stay in the saddle.  I'm going to have to widen the slot in the saddle to get the string to stay in.

Beatboxing into it sounds tight.\\n\\nThere is a lot to explore in this little synth.\", 'This review is for the microKORG XL+, which is not the original microKORG released around 2001 or the updated XL released in 2008.  The microKORG XL+ came out in 2012, and is basically a further expansion on the virtual analog (\"VA\") modeling engine used in the XL, plus some additional PCM samples (for example, there is a traditional piano sound and an M1 organ now available).\\n\\nBUILD QUALITY - The marketing of the \"XL\" and \"XL+\" is a bit confusing because I am pretty sure that both models are actually lighter, smaller, and have fewer knobs and buttons than the original microKORG (while generally going for the same price or possibly a little more).  The build quality and choice of materials is probably the poorest aspect of the XL+.  Considering that this is a product intended to retail for around $500, and comparing that to what is offered by the new Korg Minilogue and comparably priced (but functionally very different) products from Arturia and Novation, the plastic housing, plastic jacks, and semi-suspect knobs are a bit of a disappointment.  To be honest, if I were any kind of serious musician that needed to play this synth live (or even take it out of my house), I probably couldn\\'t give it a 5-star review.  But I think that it\\'s a device that should work and continue to work for many years in a home studio setting, and with reasonable care and use.\\n\\nAt the same time, Korg\\'s design choices have other advantages which become more obvious once you own and use the device for awhile.  This thing is LIGHT - weighing in at only a few pounds, it\\'s fully capable of being played on your lap comfortably (I actually played it in my car a bit the other day just because I can).  This thing is also extremely PORTABLE - not many synths with this kind of firepower can run for about 4 hours on 6 AA batteries.  You can power it with Korg\\'s KA350 9V adapter (which, unfortunately, is center-positive and a bit of a non-standard barrel size), but I\\'m thinking I\\'m just as likely to throw a set of Eneloop rechargeables in there, and it will encourage me to use it all the often.  So, yes, the XL+ doesn\\'t necessarily \"feel\" like a professional device, but at least on my unit, everything works reliably, and owning this synth begs the question about so many other mini-synths on the market: What, really, is the point of making synths smaller if they are still heavy, clumsy, and anchored to a wall adapter.  The XL+ is none of those things, and is all the better for it.\\n\\nINTERFACE & PROGRAMMING - The microKORG XL+ has 37 mini keys, and a 3-octave range (with additional octave up and down switch, of course).  Keyboards are very subjective and I find that even if you prefer a firmer or looser action on keys, your opinion may differ depending on the type of playing you are doing.  For example, I find that the firmer approach of something like Arturia MicroBrute is better for percussive monophonic sequences or \"finger drumming\", whereas the microKORG XL+ requires a much lighter touch to press the keys.  While the real estate is a bit tight and the looseness takes a little getting used to, I find it more piano-like and sensitive to subtle velocity differences than many other cheap synth and MIDI controller keyboards I have used.  I actually think I might prefer this as a pure \"keyboard\" over my CME XKey 37, which is full-size but has very non-traditional \"button\" keys.\\n\\nIt seems impossible that a synth with as few knobs and buttons as the XL+ has could have much depth, but here again Korg made some very intelligent and beginner-friendly design choices.  For example, there are only 3 parameter control knobs, but a 4th knob selects different editing \"banks\", and these are universal to all of your presets/programs.  They are also clearly labeled on the dashboard, so I was able to figure out how to tweak the release time or modify the filter without even checking the manual.  In fact, while there is a LCD screen, the XL+ is careful not to over-rely on it.  You\\'ll only really find yourself scrolling through text options on the screen if you are changing to a different effect, or making deeper parameter edits.\\n\\nOne thing the XL+ probably could have used was a button selector for quick switching between presets.  I really have no idea how you would use this thing live if you needed to change to a different preset mid-song.  The MiniNova and even some other Korg products use a button bank that is much easier to navigate on the fly.\\n\\nSOUNDS & VERSATILITY - The XL+ is a very preset-based machine, which is both good and bad.  There are two schools of thought when it comes to beginners and synths.  The first school says that every important function should get its own knob, and that you should just have a wall of choices in front of you as you learn the basics of synthesis and tweak them on a dashboard.  The second school of thought (and one that I am coming around to) is that \"more is not always better\" and that by having too many variables, you can actually frustrate and overwhelm people who just want to grab a device and make music.  The XL+ has MASSIVE power, but much of it is baked into the presets that you swap in and out and create using the computer editor.  On the PC editor, you can do things like access Korg\\'s library of programs based on VA subtractive synthesis or PCM samples.  I\\'m totally blown away by how varied the sounds are in the XL+.  Combined with 8-note polyphony, it\\'s capable deep sub basses, haunting pads, chiptune leads, and warm vintage analog poly chords.\\n\\nBut probably my favorite aspect of the XL+ is how useful it is in my workflow.  The on-board sounds are great on their own, but the XL+ is also an outstanding (and very portable) MIDI controller.  It even supplies MIDI power, so I can use it with a sound module like the Ploytec PL2, or even power the Retrokits RK002 Midiator cable designed for the Volca Sample and Volca FM.  It has a headphone jack (1/4\") and two 1/4\" outputs for a mixer, computer interface, or recording device.  There is also an input jack so you can apply external sounds to Korg\\'s excellent filters and effects.\\n\\nI\\'m relatively new to hardware synthesizers, but even in my limited experience with other budget/compact gear, the microKORG XL+ really stands out.  The wildly popular Arturia MicroBrute and MiniBrute are great devices, but they\\'re also monosynths and far more limited in scope than the XL+.  I own basically all of the Korg Volca series, and while those are great devices, I feel like the microKORG XL+ covers about 90-95% of the sounds I could conceivably make with the Volca Bass, Keys, and FM combined.  Not to mention that it comes with a 37-key keyboard that you can actually play, that can be powered by battery, and that you can effectively use as a MIDI keyboard with some of your other devices.  The microKORG XL+ isn\\'t the newest or sexiest toy on block, but remains an example of \"digital done right\".  It\\'s capable of playing hundreds of different sounds from some of Korg\\'s best products of the past 20 years, and allowing the user to tweak them even further with a simple layout of knobs on the device.  I think it could be the integral component to a budget home studio, especially combined with a good drum machine and mono synth for bass/lead work.', 'Product not as described', \"Got one of these when they first came out, and had a lot of fun with it.

I used it and enjoyed it fully, but always wanted to go further than this puppy would take me.  Still, i want to mention that i did enjoy playing with this small keyboard quite a bit, and was tempted to buy the Rackmount version (MS2000) to see if it would be a deeper machine.\\nI did and it was.

I am a big fan of tangerine dream, the blade runner soundtrack, as well as other vangelis albums, so there is some stuff in here that gets me to where I want to go. I just got it, but the more I tinker, the more I am happy with what sounds and tones I find.\\n\\nI wanted to end this on the controversy of the mini-keys. I at first didn\\'t mind the idea, seeing as how, as they say in videos \"you use one hand on the keys, the other one twiddling knobs\". then as I actually got it and started playing, I realized something better that I haven\\'t seen mentioned yet, though I didn\\'t read all the reviews here, but it\\'s safe to say NO ONE ELSE HAS SAID THIS, so gather round, make some s\\'mores, get your camo-snuggie on. the smaller keys works wonders for playing EXTENDED chords, so, to try to be clear and helpful, you start on one key, then, say, the next key you hit is 3 away from that one, usually chords only go like another 2 or 3 keys from that one, these little keys let you really stretch and easily make up chords that wouldn\\'t be possible on a full sized keyboard, or if they did, you would have to use both hands, or overdub. does that make sense? trick question, it does, press rewind if I haven\\'t...well you get it.\\n\\nso the smaller keys actually is awesome, especially for electronic forms of music, where the chords used can be stranger than regular chords played on the piano. once I figured that out, this device became something more special than it already was.\\n\\nwhat? what\\'s that? vocoder? yeah, it\\'s awesome. don\\'t want to call it novelty, but it would be something tough to use all the time, especially recording and having every song with it on there, but it\\'s here, it works, and it works well. will use more in time, for sure, will probably write whole songs with it, lol.\\n\\nI got the vintage gold, which is the winner hands down! but this model has the most reviews, so I wanted to be included in this one.

Its truly one of a kind music instrument. I would highly recommend it!!', 'Synth snobs call the Microkorg a toy. I don\\'t argue with them. I feel like a kid on Christmas morning every time I turn it on!\\n\\nLet\\'s start by saying the MK kicks proverbial butt and then discuss the few things some people complain about.\\n\\n1. Mini keys: I started out as a guitarist, making lots of very small movements to play my instruments, so mini keys are fine. Pianists don\\'t like them. But then, I don\\'t like piano keys; they\\'re like using a sledge hammer to drive a thumbtack. I have some full-size keyboards and I can\\'t play those monster keys as deftly as I can play the short-travel minis on the MK. And if you want big keys, just midi any big keyboard to the MK. Problem solved.\\n\\nWell, that just about wraps up the complaint department.\\n\\nThe MK is a lap-size portable with the sonic power of a room full of vintage equipment. There are other synths in its size and price range but I don\\'t think they sound better (personal preference) and they\\'re not as easy to program. If I could have only one synth it would be a Microkorg.\\n\\nIn 2012, just to see if I could, I did everything on the MK. You can hear all my 2012 tunes at aejotz.com. Some of the sounds are presets, some are tweaked presets, some are patches I found online and some I programmed from scratch. I used no effects and the only non-MK sound you\\'ll hear is the metronome click from my recorder, which I decided to leave on a couple of tracks. Long story short, I really put that \"toy\" through its paces.\\n\\n(The tracks from 1983 are all Casio MT-65. The tracks from 2011 and 2013 can be any mixture of Microkorg, Casio CZ-101, Alesis Micron, Arturia Minibrute, Yamaha PSR-520 and a few other gadgets.)', 'Here\\'s my two-cents...\\n\\nSynth Engine\\nFor starters, the 4 voice synth engine is solid and has the ability to create some amazing sounds that span the entire audio spectrum from gut churning basses to angelic and ethereal pads. That said, the 128 presets that it ships with are pretty decent to get you started, but PLEASE refrain from using them in your recordings/performances without doing a decent amount of tweaking and effecting. The mK seems to have a very unique sonic footprint, and since so many people own this synth, using the presets as-is is definitely going to be frowned upon. Of course this can be said about any synth, but especially for the microKORG. There\\'s nothing quite as anticlimactic as seeing a band perform live using the mK and you recognize they\\'re using factory preset A43. True story. The built-in delay/ensemble effects are great, but I think the mK sounds 1000x better when ran through some outboard effects. If I want a sick and meaty low-end bass that easily lends itself to (gag) dubstep or drum & bass, I\\'ll run the mono output of the Korg to an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Electro-Harmonix-Bass-Big-Muff-Distortion-Pedal/dp/B001C1A6CI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Electro-Harmonix Bass Big Muff Distortion Pedal</a>&nbsp;and then directly to the board or to a bass amp. It\\'s pretty filthy.\\n\\nEditing\\nEditing and tweaking your own patches is easy enough via the seven knobs and 3 character LED screen, but it tends to be a time-consuming process, especially since there\\'s no visual feedback of your tweaks. If membrane style programming isn\\'t your bag, then you should definitely download the free microKORG Patch Editor, however since the mK lacks USB connectivity, I suggest the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/M-Audio-USB-Midisport-Uno-MIDI-Interface/dp/B00007JRBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">M-Audio USB Midisport Uno MIDI Interface</a>. Both the MIDI implementation and the editor are a tad wonky, but you will be able to visually access and edit all of the synth\\'s parameters. Adding to the USB/MIDI functionality, once you\\'ve made your connection, you can also sequence the mK from your workstation (Ableton, FL Studio, Sonar, etc.) via MIDI out. This of course, opens up a whole new world of possibilities and will really let you unleash the power of the microKORG. Finally, since the synth engine is same one used in the Korg MS-2000, you can import MS-2000 patches into the mK by means of sysex files. You\\'ll need a MIDI utility such as MIDI OX, and from there, it\\'s gets a little complicated, but if you\\'re a true synth-geek and you want your microKORG to sound like an MS-2000, it might be worth it.\\n\\nVocoder\\nTruth be told, this was a key factor in my decision to purchase the mK as I wanted it for live vocoding. Software/VST vocoders are great, but they tend to be process hogs, especially in live situations, so for this reason alone, I insisted on the hardware route. Upon setup, the first thing you need to do is replace the freebie gooseneck microphone that it ships with. A lot of the reviews that I\\'ve read say that the mK\\'s vocoder sucks, which if you use the gooseneck, I somewhat agree with, however after popping in an inexpensive dynamic mic, the quality difference is absolutely amazing. Also, depending on your intentions, the supplied vocoder patches are pretty lame, so you will definitely want to create your own, either manually or with the software editor, especially if you\\'re going for the traditional robot/Cylon effect. On a final, yet critical note, since the mK only boasts an 8 band vocoder, I strongly suggest running the output through an EQ to enhance the mids and highs.\\n\\nBuild/Layout\\nUnless you\\'re one of those types who regularly abuses your equipment, the mK is built solid enough for stage use, but then again, I\\'m also the type that tends to baby my gear. Right out of the box, the faux wood side-panels felt a tad loose, which made it feel a little flimsy, but after a few turns with the screwdriver, they were nice and tight and it definitely felt more solid. I\\'ve also noticed that a lot of people seem to complain about the keys, either their size or feel. I do admit that they do take a little getting used to, but unless you\\'re recreating Flight of the Bumblebee, you should be able to manage just fine, even with stubby little sausage fingers. Naturally, if worse comes to worse, you can always connect a full size MIDI controller and use the mK as a stand-alone sound module. As far as running via battery power, the concept is pretty cool, but be warned, they do drain pretty quickly and will give you a little over an hour of playing and tweaking. I\\'ve never been the type to rely on battery power, especially for outboard gear or effect pedals, so I would suggest sticking with the wall-wart. Lastly, don\\'t be fooled by the bank names on the Program Select panel because they really don\\'t do any justice for the mK. I\\'m sure \"Trance\", \"Techno/House\", \"Electronica\", etc. were used for marketing purposes by satisfying the instant gratification factor for that out-of-box experience.\\n\\nIn Summation\\nIf you have one, keep it \\'n tweak it, and if you\\'re on the fence about getting one; get it! I know there are literally thousands of VSTi plugins that that have more bells and whistles in one oscillator than the mK has in total, but for the price, you get a lot of bang for your buck, plus a cool piece of hardware. I\\'m not saying that it\\'s an all-in-one or everyday synth, but it\\'s definitely a cool piece of kit to have in your arsenal. Lastly, if you\\'re looking for an easy talkbox solution (a la Roger Troutman), I suggest pairing your microKORG with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rocktron-Banshee-2/dp/B0014Z37H8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rocktron Banshee 2</a>.', \"I'm not a keyboardist, but bought this for my daughter.  I have played around with it quite a bit and find the sound amazing.  It's most obvious flaw (small keys with only three octaves) can easily be solved.  We have a cheap, old Casio with full size keys and six octaves.  I just ran a MIDI cable out from the Casio into the Microkorg and, voila, you can play the Casio and hear the Microkorg.  Of course, I also had to buy a dual mount stand (which looks really cool), but it improved the usefulness of the Microkorg threefold.  Also, each voice on the Casio creates a new sounds with each voice on the Microkorg.  If you have the Casio volume down all the way, you can't hear its output; or, you can run a cable into the amp and hear both the actual sound of the Casio voice PLUS the Casio/Microkorg voice PLUS the Microkorg voice by itself (if you reach up and hit those keys).

It feels pretty tight and no internal buzzing that I was aware of the cabinet area. There may be some built in modeling of which is not disclosed.  It has that British Jangly distorted tone on the 2nd channel.  On  the clean channel,  using the gain upwards of 3/4 will give you the introduction of some distorted tones and mimicking a valve type amp.  I was overall impressed with how nice it does sound, so much so that I may get second one for another room, perhaps the red special edition at the same price or the version with the British flag in white.\\n\\nThe only negative was the lack of a reverb.  Even if they would have added a digital modeled reverb, it would have been a great add on, but this bare bones amp is probably light years ahead of the amp I started on with which was a small Transistor Sears amp in the mid to late 70's..\\n\\nAs far as recording goes, using an external Mic would be no problem.  Understand that the smaller an amp is, the close proximity of a Microphone will make it sound larger.  It's only in open air and further away that the sound of the smaller speaker will show it's tininess.  If you have this amp at or near ear level or pointed up towards you at about 4-5 feet away, it sounds like a larger amp.  Regardless, I was impressed.

Started looking at amps and was blown away by the sound of a VOX AC4TV (clean/warm tone). Almost ready to buy it, but then decided to see what else was out there. Began seriously considering the Fender Mustang series. Only problem is I really didn't want to keep toying with the computer to achieve the sound I knew I wanted - and I do like to tinker with settings. I also couldn't justify the great expense at this time (I think the mustang is shackled until you get the III with the interface). Kept digging a little more. How can I get the rich VOX sound I wanted? I also knew I just had to have a 12 inch speaker.. right? Wrong. My venue 99.9% of the time right now is my living room and bed room. I realized I would not be able to fully appreciate a 12 inch speaker until properly driven with 20-40 watts. I already knew the pawn shop 15w peavey rage I had could get really loud ... did I need really loud? Would that increase my amount of practice time? No - going back and reassessing... I wanted that VOX tone. Ok - but I had the VOX stomplab (see my other review... also soon to be updated), and it could make the VOX series of sounds... really nice through good headphones - I guess ok in the Peavey. Still fighting back discontent - what was it I was looking for??? Simplicity, tone, and price (and no concern for tube maintenance) - not necessarily in that order.\\n\\nI found the Pathfinder at a local shop (not my local GC). I took a couple minutes with the display model to see if I was achieving the warmth I was looking for. It took less time than I figured to decided that at this price, I would be satisfied. Did I side by side test the pathfinder with the mustang? not yet. Maybe I will one day.\\n\\nWhat am I doing more of than before with the Pathfinder? Practicing/playing.\\n\\nMy current setup is an Epiphone SG Pro with a VOX Stomplab IIG and now the Pathfinder.\\nThe pathfinder adds enough of the warm VOX tone I was looking for with all knobs set at 12 o'clock and the channel set to clean. I can make adjustments to tone with the SG Pro's volume/tone knobs and coil tapping. I'm not looking for extreme sounds - so generally I use the Stomplab for some variety of reverb, delay, and/or chorus AND the pedal is a big plus for master volume control. If I want gain/overdrive/distortion - I leave the pathfinder alone. I rely on the stomplab for the gritty sound I want. It has a much better capacity to deliver in that arena.\\n\\nThis is my poor man's audio chain. The only thing I can improve at this time is my playing. If I am ever lucky enough to gig/play with others - and if the Pathfinder won't mike well - then I may consider something bigger/better. For now - big isn't everything for me. The Pathfinder has won me over.\\n\\nI'm only a couple days into playing with this setup and if I ever get tired of it or it stops working well for this beginner/intermediate - I will post otherwise.\", \"Great little Amp. There's a lot of sound here.\", \"I'm a gigging musician and over the past 5 or 6 six years I have been trying lots of gear to run direct to the PA.  I am just tired of lugging the tube amps.  This amp is analog not digital.  I like that. I have gigged it mic'd up with a SM57.  It was great.  It is taking the place of my direct setup. This is supposed to be a practice amp but I use it as a pro gigging amp.  No issues.  My present setup is minimal: Strats or p90 guitars to Boss tuner->TC Helicon voice harmonizer->Cry Baby->Xotic SP Comp->Voodoo Labs Micro-vibe->Mad Professor-> Simble Overdrive->Xotic EP Booster->Boss DD6 Delay->Hotone little delay pedal (forgot name)->Vox Pathfinder.  It loves all of the time based pedals.  You really have to work and tweak the overdrive pedals to get it to work for you. I'm not a distortion guy. SRV, CCR, Hendrix, Trower, KWS covers etc. Beats lugging the real Fender amps and only I notice the difference in sound.  It sounds good enough for the small 100 people venues. I will be buying a second one soon to run stereo chorus and delay.\", 'I got exactly what I wanted with this amp. I wanted a cheap, vintage-looking amp that sounded good enough for quietly noodling around at home.

For its size it is a scream with excellent tone..', 'This amp is the boss!', \"Not a big fan of the distortion sound on this thing, and you can definitely tell it's a lower wattage amp. If you're just needing something for practice, then this works. If you're wanting to get a real distorted or overdriven type of sound, it's not great.\", 'What can I say. This Amp received rave reviews on the Internet. After receiving it and plugging it in the Amp is even better than the Internet Reviews. If you like the warm big sound Vox has always had you will like this little Guy. Amazing Amp for the money and it is really classy looking also.', \"I play music regularly at restaurants and sometimes you'll be in a venue where less is definitely more and you don't want overkill.  This amp is perfect for those kind of situations.  It has great tone for a small solid state amp.  It's also really easy to travel with.\\n\\nIf you're looking for an affordable and dependable amp with tonal qualities that you can not only bear but enjoy this is a great amp to purchase.\", \"It's incredibly small, it looks swell (in that granny in the '40s Vox way) and it sounds ridiculously good for its size and price (and solid state setup).

Great bedroom or practice amp at a great price!\", 'I played a AC30 a couple of weeks before I bought this amp, and it\\'s because I was hooked on the clean VOX sound. I read a lot of reviews and did my research and it seemed like this amp would be the best for me. I\\'m living in a college apartment so I didn\\'t want to go too big and annoy my neighbors. I also didn\\'t have much of a budget for a guitar amp, so I decided to buy low. The package came in a couple of days later and I opened it up and was amazed at the size of this thing! The picture makes it look like an eraser but it\\'s the size of a man\\'s shoebox. The clean channel sounds unbelievably clean. I couldn\\'t help but compare it to my old Ibanez IBZ-10 Tone Blaster Amp which sounded like there was a perpetual colony of bees hiving inside the speaker. The volume gets pretty loud even for its size and it still maintains that clean sound even at 12 gain and 12 volume. The \"overdrive\" setting is cool too. I haven\\'t tinkered with that one too much, but it\\'s fun to play \"Johnny B. Goode\" on.\\n\\nI didn\\'t want to buy an amp that had all of the shiny bells and whistles that fall off after the first month. I wanted a quality amp for a low price, and I got it. You can always buy pedals to get all those cool sounds, and I plan on doing that too, but you need a good amp with a good clean channel like this one before you start getting into other effects. I would definitely recommend this amp to the college apartment dweller and to anyone else who wants an amazing practice amp.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if this would be the best gigging amp though, but then again, I don\\'t see myself gigging anytime soon.', 'I just wanted a cheap practice amp and the VOX is perfect. Sounds great and can be quite loud with gain and overdrive on. Also looks really cool( vintage) looks like something the Beatles would have  used. Am using an acoustic/ electric with clean channel most of the time and am very happy the way it amplifies an acoustic guitar', 'The Pathfinder 10 is a great practice amp...practice amp. in fact this amps sweet spot (matter of opinion) is found at a very low volume. I play primarily through an American Deluxe Strat-HSS. My LP is too hot and sounds kind of like hot trash through it.\\n\\nFirst, what I would not do with this amp - \"gig\" with it. Play it out, play it live or with a drummer. It is a $70 - 10w solid state amp. You have to crank it to do those things and solid state amps just don\\'t sound as good maxed as they do at mid levels. This amp sounds terrible with everything dimed. That doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t...and if your budget is only $70 for your amp, then do what you gotta do.\\n\\nWhat is has. Gain control & channel, volume, bass and treble. Using the gain channel as a distortion doesn\\'t sound great to me. In fact it sounds like a can of bees. Not the good Cobain kind of bees; the, \"I think your amp is smokng, dude,\" kind of bees.\\n\\nHowever, using the gain control (not channel) and volume together creates a very full clean sound. Some of my pedals like clean boosts or clean drives don\\'t really do much with the Pathfinder, but they are designed for tube amps and that is understandable (refer to above \"bee\" sounds for a better description). Also, analog delay doesn\\'t sound great, but digital delays and light reverb are cool (of course).\\n\\nI use it for true bedroom practice. and just wanted something that I could run my pedal board into that had a little character. We also have had a Roland Microcube in the house, but it is very sterile sounding. The Vox actually carries that Vox tone and has a bit of warmth. I\\'ve also spent a lot of time on the AC4TV tube amp and that is much better, but also a lot louder and $300.\\n\\nI do knock of stars for the non existant gain and amps intolerance for effects. For the price, less than a cheap effect pedal or video game with some DLC, this is an awesome value and really good clean practice amp. Again, if you need to practice your Meshuggah riffs, you need to look elsewhere. A tiny bit of reverb and delay sounds really good and for open chording or practicing with your headphones on, this is a great investment.', \"This is the perfect practice amp for bedroom or living room.  First of all, it's small.  Second, it sounds great!  The clean channel provides classic Vox sound and the dirty channel is pretty good as well.  Would be nice if it had reverb, but for $69, I can't complain.  Yes, this is a great practice amp!  I bet running two of these in stereo with a Boss chorus pedal would sound fantastic.\", \"impulse buy after I was made at my wife.  amp stands for everything I despise.  Cheap.  Made in China.  Solid State.  yet the OD is old school and to die for.  It's my first VOX.  I cascade OD and this OD functions just on the edge of dysfunction, and it's totally addictive.  I plug it thru a 4X12 which really loses the SS tone.  It just oozes MAD tone.  Obviously I had to strip a guitar cord to plug into large 8 Ohm speakers.  I own 3 other tube Amps (Ampeg, Fuchs and Blackheart) and 2 or 3 (2 Marshall, Roland) solid states.  This amp fills a very nice void other Amps can't provide.

A good clean sound that's fine for practice...\", 'I purchased this PG56-LC to expand my existing Shure PGDMK6-XLR drum set microphone kit which already contains 3 PG56 mics, but I have a 1 snare + 4 toms, so I needed 2 more in order to have individual mics for each tom.  In my experience so far it is easier to extract good sound from drums with individual mics rather than trying to capture multiple items with a single mic.  On the other hand, I see (hear) no need to have individual mics for hi-hat and other cymbals when I use two PG81 condenser mics overhead.  The supplied cable with PG56-XLR is only 15 ft long, which even in my small setup is too short (need 25 ft), so opted for the -LC version.  These mics sound awesome, very warm and clean. The PG56s are super directional and pickup almost nothing from other drums when mounted on the supplied A50D rim mounts and pointed towards the drum head. Note that the current amazon description for PG56-LC omits the fact that an A50D rim mount is included in each PG56-LC package (I have submitted a modification request for the description that corrects this omission).

I had the first pair about 2 years when the plastic covering over the foam earcups started to shred and peel off. The sound was pretty good so I bought a new pair. The original phones came with a 1/4\" male plug and a 1/8\" adapter. The new ones came with a 1/8\" plug and a 1/4\" adapter. The first thing I noticed on the new pair was that the stereo separation was very poor. The left and right channels were pretty close to being the same. I tested the old headphones and the separation was noticeably better. But on the new set it is pretty poor, probably about 75% crossover on both ears. If you don\\'t care that much about stereo channel separation, and are willing to peel off the plastic film off the foam ear cans when it starts shredding off, then this is a decent sounding set of earphone for the money.\\nDiscovered a work around for the separation problem. Using the 1/4\" adapter that came with the set, I then use a 1/8\" adapter over the 1/4\" adapter, to bring the jack back to 1/8\".

Obviously the sound quality isn't on-par with the Beats for this price, but it isn't meant to be. The quality is though, plenty sufficient to me. If the speakers produced a bit more low-end these would probably be the perfect pair of headphones. I record music at home and when someone is recording their instrument I'll let them wear the Beats while I wear these. They cancel a bit of noise due to their over-the-ear design, they sound great, and (most importantly?) they are extremely comfortable. I can wear these through hours of recording with no regrets.

The coil starts about 18\" down, which is perfect imo because you don\\'t want the coil next to your face.

I team these up with my Porta-Booth [[ASIN:B0015TFO24 Porta-booth - Portable Sound Studio with Two Compression Sacs] and VO: 1-A microphone [ASIN:B002SMYUFY VO: 1-A Harlan Hogan Signature Series Voice Over Microphone] on the road.\\n\\nH2[\", 'The first rule of microphones is that, \"No one microphone is perfect for every purpose.\"  Rule two is, \"Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound.\"  I\\'ve used Shure SM58\\'s along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968.  I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used (and still do use) them for singing some back up vocals.\\n\\nThe SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use.  Some people, me included, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic, the Shure SM-57.  The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice.  For example, anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58.  People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.\\n\\nThe SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means the bass increases the closer you get.)  This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away.  The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don\\'t sound right.  On the other hand, the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the user\\'s mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away.  While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic, there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly.  It works ok for conga drums and the like, but the SM-58 is about the last thing you\\'d want to use to mic a sax or guitar.  Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice, but for some people they sound great.  The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen.  However for other people the SM-58 works better.  It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do.  If you have a very deep voice, the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response.\\n\\nOne certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability.  This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal.  Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a slight extra cost) with a built-in on/off switch.  The SM-58\\'s ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars.  I\\'ve seen SM-58\\'s dented, rusty, dusty, smoked up, spit into, with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet I\\'ve never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it.\\n\\nAll the pro-line Shure mics are top quality.  The pro line Shures also hold their value well.  If you buy one and decide you don\\'t like it, you can get about what you paid for it on eBay.  I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one.  Senneheiser\\'s EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look. The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice.  These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they\\'d still be around for another 20 years at least.', 'Excellent', 'This thing is a workhorse', 'good product', 'Shure SM58 LC is a real beaut.

There is no need to use phantom power for this mic so it saves battery life if you're using a pre-amp or have it connected to an XLR input on a professional camcorder.

You see these things pop up everywhere, from studios to live gigs to concerts on TV.  They are everywhere.  Which I find a bit strange because, frankly, they don\\'t sound good.\\n\\nThe design of these mics goes back about 40 years.  A lot has happened with microphone technology during that time.  These models may have been very good decades ago, but they are really showing their age.  The most prominent problem with them is the sound quality... they are quite \"honky\" making everyone sound far more nasal than they do in real life.  There are some situations where that might be okay, but unless you are a vocalist who actually wants to sound more nasal than you do in reality, there are much better choices out there, as these two mics will really emphasize any honkiness/nasality of your voice.\\n\\nIn a shootout in my studio with more than 20 different models of mics, the SM57/58 were clearly near the bottom of the list.  Virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better.  And I\\'m not talking about comparing it to $3500 Neumann U87 mics either... half of the mics we used can be had for under $150.  Another, much better choice in a similar price range is the AKG D5, or you can step up to the Shure Beta 58, which is much, much better, and a microphone I can easily recommend.  Both of these other mics also have better off-axis rejection and higher gain before feedback.\\n\\nI know that nearly everyone uses these mics, but that doesn\\'t actually mean they are that good.  There are much better choices for your money.  \"Tradition\" alone isn\\'t a great reason to buy a particular product, especially in a technology-heavy field.\\n\\nOn the plus side, both the SM57 and SM58 are nearly bullet-proof.  You can really abuse them and they\\'ll sound just like they did when they were brand-new.\\n\\nAside from the extreme durability (which is now nearly standard in similarly-priced models), the only other reason to consider an SM58 instead of another option is if you want to be the lazy sound guy that doesn\\'t want to even try to create a proper mix and prefers to rely on the odd mid-range peak of this mic to make a vocal cut through a mix of instruments.  Please take note, though, that doesn\\'t mean that it is going to sound great... just that you\\'ll have that odd and annoying honky peak standing out in the mix over everything else.  If you like being the sound engineer that doesn\\'t want to mess with proper mic selection and bother with equalization to create a good mix, maybe the SM57/SM58 actually are the mics for you.  (Inevitably when I attend an event with a terrible mix I\\'ll see SM58s all over the stage.)  As for me and anyone else that makes sound quality and great mixes a priority, we\\'ll probably select something else.', 'It is not a bad mic for the price ( If you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks) but it is no comparison to a studio mic since I have worked in a recording studio. Now, you need to decide what you want, getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for; it is like having HD TV and BD player but playing an ordinary CD. You would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer, speakers and so on. If you are a home or hobby user, then go for this mic. This mic is quite good for its price. I would probably say, it exceeds your expectations.\\n\\nArrived as promised in a frustration free packing. Also, make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit.\\n\\nThe only reason I did not give 5 stars is , mine had a little dent on the body ( may be due to transportation) but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks.', \"How do you review an SM58??

They shipped in less time than expected.\\n\\nI'm a really happy customer now.\", \"Are there other dynamic microphones that are better sounding than the SM58?  Yes.  Then why have I given it a 5 star?  Well I am glad you asked.  It's a legendary piece of musical equipment.  The microphone has existed for half a century, and I am willing to bet for all of you that are reading this that it will still exist when we all pass away.  There are three things that will survive a nuclear bomb.  Roaches, Keith Richards, and the SM58!  The durability of this microphone is amazing.  Just  youtube  SM58 and you will see some durability experiments that will speak for it self.  It can stand abuse like no other microphone period.  SM58 are standards live microphones in the industry.  Do they sound better than some Beyerdynamic Opus models or Sennheisers?  My opinion would be no, but you take to consideration when you have a Sound company they will use 80% to 90% of the time a SM58.  The reason is most soundmen have learned to eq around it and they are familiar with that microphone.  A sound guy that does not know a SM58 is not a sound technician to begin with.  If you know a little eq you can make this mic sound very good.  You buy a fancy dynamic mic and you run the risk of a sound guy screwing up your sound.  Anybody bashing this mic has to be reminded that legendary singers have all sung on a sm58 at one point.  From Robert Plant to Sinatra.  Not to mention every time you see a major festival it's the main mic on stage.  This mic has not changed it's specs or design since the 1960's.  What does that tell you?  For about $99 you have invested in microphone that will be with you most of your life.\", 'In the immortal words that John Cameron Swayze used when hawking his Timex watches during the early days of live television, the Shure SM58 Vocal mic fits perfectly into that same category.\\n\\nBefore I found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer, I played in rock bands and did live sound mixing. One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58. Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966, the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.\\n\\nThe mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side. There is a 4K bump in it\\'s frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise. Construction is rugged, frequency response is 50 to 15,000 Hz, and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.\\n\\nWe used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn\\'t find one, just grab one of these, they are that tough. I\\'ve seen some of these on the road that you couldn\\'t believe still worked, but they did and sounded great.\\n\\nThe cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only it\\'s distinctive look, one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced, but it\\'s part of the functionality. Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam, the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element.

Apparently, you shouldn't skimp on your XLR cables--something I didn't know until reading these reviews and searching online.\\n\\nI give this product three stars simply because it works out of the box, without any noise issues that I can hear.

Works, but feels cheap.', 'Everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another.  I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters.  Unfortunately that design isn\\'t used here, but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15\\' of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends (M and F) for well under $1/ft.\\n\\nAs for pinout it\\'s straightforward, pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends, while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends.  The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I haven\\'t had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer\\'s kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises.\\n\\nAnother favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/GLS-Audio-3ft-Patch-Cable-Cords-XLR-Male-To-XLR-Female-Black-Cables-3-Balanced-Snake-Cord-6-PACK/dp/B000RYP83I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3\\' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK</a>&nbsp;- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone\\'s oddball source signal.  Having 6 on hand means you won\\'t quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.\\n\\nBack to pyle\\'s product here, I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since it\\'s 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot.  It\\'s also great when someone yells \"it\\'s too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium!\" and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn\\'t planned for or got moved/quit working.  For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.\\n\\nI finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer\\'s tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit. With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of \"what if\" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner\\'s daugher\\'s toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.\\n\\nMy last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made.  It will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you\\'ll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem.  People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position.  My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn\\'t serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry.  I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console.', 'It works very well so long as the cable isn\\'t too twisted. I had to duct-tape the cable at the part before the prong comes out to help eliminate wire buzz. It only happened when the cord wasn\\'t coming straight out of the input jack, and bent at that \"joint\"\\notherwise, you can\\'t beat this for price. If you are new to the music scene, I recommend this and just deal with duct taping it to work if you have to cause it\\'s not worth buying a more expensive one when it\\'ll probably work fine or may just need some minor adjustments.', 'I needed microphone cables for a home studio, and I bought three of these. They work, and they have the advantage of being newer than most mic cables I have used to play gigs.', 'The price was right, delivery was fast, and the cable serves its intended purpose well!

This thing screamed, right out of the box! One warning for beginners, the neck is very narrow.

And I do not mean serious in terms of wanting to really be a pro guitarist... I just mean, if you are serious in trying to learn guitar... do not.  These things are always overly cheap and unplayable.  I have a few cheap models of Silvertone guitars that are for display purposes only (signed by artists) and, trust me, as a guitarist who owns many guitars, I cant even play these things. They are so cheap, the strings do not stay in tune, usually have intonation problems (cant clear frets and thus buzz and pop or never have proper note frequences at all the frets).  They usually always feel cheap too and the feel does affect the playability and tone.  If you want to really learn you have to pay at least a little more and go for better brands.  I would recommend anyone serious in learning to never buy a guitar that costs under $300... you are just wasting your money and the problems and limitations may even frustrate you and work against you learning how to play.  Go for the brands that are made by the bigger dogs... like ESP's LTD brand... Gibson's Epiphone brand, or Fender's lower brand (Squire?).  There are other examples.  I am sure Ibanez has some good lower models (though I am not sure they have a lower brand name for their cheaper gear).  If you do have to go for a cheaper brand, at least then buy their top of the line models (this pertains to Dean, for example).

The guitar sounds better on a good amp but the problem w/ this guitar is the tuning pegs they tighten if you switch to heavy gauge strings (SO DON'T SWITCH TO HEAVY GAUGE OR YOU WILL SUFFER!) stick with light or medium gauge strings.

The pickup selector switch would cause bursts of static when switching while playing - cheap pickups and very little tone control - even though this is meant to resemble a Fender Strat - that's the extent of any comparison.

I bought the Black package, and it looks good in the living room on a stand.\\n\\nOverall the kit is decent.  Is it a 4 star product . . . no, but its price and how its packaged added points.\\n\\nThe amp is not loud or low enough for a Bass, but again if you are just learning it will have no problem getting the job done.  Do not assume it will be heard over any other instrument though.  The guitar is passive, meaning you will have to crank the amp to get some volume out of it. It does a great job in the living room just making noises as I pluck, smack, and push around the strings.  As I have no idea what Im doing, thats why I bought the kit. My wife who has been playing 75% of her life picked it up, tuned it ( not with the tuner it came with) and just started jamming away.  She was impressed with it as it was just a $135 package she was smiling the whole time goofing off with it.  So it will do its job for what I want.\\n\\nThe Guitar is pretty, sounds good, action is high.  I mention the action as high, as when your banging away on bass if its a low action you will get buzzing, this one has no such issue.  The only 2 gripes I have with the Bass itself is 1) its passive, so to use it with my pc or playstation (Rocksmith) I will need a preamp, 2) the picture of all 3 types have a thumb rest.  It is 100% the reason I bought this kit over the Dean, and its no there.  Oh well its home now, so itll do.  Just disappointing that its no as pictured.  Again it plays nice, sounds good on the tiny amp, wife had no complaints when jamming so Ill chalk it up to a win.\\n\\nThe Tuner it came with is small, very tidy, and doesnt work on the E string.  It works on my acoustic, and electrics as it uses vibration not sound to register.  Would not tune in the bass it came with.  I like the style of it so it will be donated to my church for them to use on stage.\\n\\nBag is just a bag\\n\\nStrap will cut your head off after a few hours.  Its rough, its slim, its short, and its sharp.  You will die if you use it more than an hour.', 'ive benn playing this bass for 2 years everyday its a great bass for beginners but out of the box its not set up right  but what cheap bass is set up right out of the box. but after 2 years of changing stuff its a great bass even played a show with it', 'NICE', \"This is a good set for a beginner or for a parent to buy their child who is interested in learning to play.  However, the quality of all the gear included is very low.  This was a Christmas present to myself, and I'm already looking to purchase a new guitar, strap and cord in the very near future.\\n\\nYou really can't beat the price for all the gear included, but you get what you pay for.  If you or your child take a true interest in the instrument, you'll be investing in better quality gear very soon thereafter.  If not, you're only out 200 bucks.\", 'I play several instruments and have recently decided to give the bass a try.  I placed my order on Thursday, it shipped Friday and I received it Monday.  Mine was sold by American Music Outlet. The shipping time was great and it was double boxed.\\n\\nGuitar: Looks nice and setup and intonation was perfect right out of the box. I was a little surprised by the fact that the neck looks to be unfinished wood.  I\\'m a little concerned about this and debating as to whether to try to put some type of sealant / finish on it for protection.  There is a minor problem with the tone control on the guitar, but I\\'ve spent many years working in electronics and it will be easier to just fix it than return the guitar I think.  These are the type things I\\'ve come to expect to have to deal with when you buy imported products online cheap.\\n\\nI think a new set of strings will improve the performance immensely.  The stock strings sound ok but they seem to be very course wound and are pretty noisy when you move your fingers on them.  I may put a set of flats on it.  The neck has a minor little cosmetic nick or two in the wood, but they have no effect on its playing and are basically invisible unless your are inspecting it very closely from inches away.  The guitar is a nice weight and the neck unexpectedly thin, which is nice if you have smaller hands as I do. It is a very attractive instrument overall and plays very nicely.\\n\\nAmp: It is a 10 watt practice amp, and that is basically what it is good for.  You might get enough volume to play with a small acoustic group (which is what I do), but it you are going to play with other amplified instruments, plan on buying a real amp. The amp does look fairly well made, and has EQ controls and a headset jack.  It has a nice sound, just not overly loud.  There is some hum but I believe this to be from the cheap cable supplied with it.  In my case it could also be coming from the problem with the tone control mentioned above.\\n\\nAccessories: As stated in other reviews, the accessories are nothing to write home about.  The case fits well and the zipper works smoothly, but has absolutely no padding. It will keep the dust off and give you a carrying handle, but that\\'s about it. The strap is about a $10 nylon strap...you\\'ll probably want something more comfortable if you plan on playing much.  As mentioned earlier, the cable from the guitar to the amp is a very cheap one.  It probably causes hum and at best will not hold up very long. I have a bunch of good cables, so that\\'s not really an issue.  The tuner supplied works fine.  Put the batteries in, switch the switch to \"Bass\" and tune for the green lights on the appropriate string notes.  Mine was very close to being in tune out of the box, just a slight bit low on all strings. The tuners on the guitar work smoothly.  I haven\\'t even looked at the DVD, but according to other reviews, it is not all that great.  I bought this package for the guitar and amp, so the accessories are not really that big of a concern to me. I will throw a tip in...there is a very good, complete beginners course available online at studybass.com, and it is absolutely free.\\n\\nOverall: I stole this for $131 shipped! Last one at that price. These are going online from $169.95 to $199.95.  Considering that, I would say that I\\'m pretty pleased with it. It\\'s well worth what I paid, even with having to make a minor repair. If you\\'re looking to pick up a playable bass and practice amp on the cheap, its probably a decent buy at the $169 range.  If I were going to spend much more than that, however, I think I would probably go with the Peavey guitar/amp package that sells for around $100 more. The main reason being that it comes with a bigger amp that would probably be a little more versatile for things other than practice.', 'I play guitar and bought this kit just to have a bass and I am very happy. No it is not the quality of a P-Bass or other more pro bass but it is great for learning or just playing with. I owned this same bass and sold it a few years back and for its price range it is the best bass I have ever played, so I got another one.\\nThe tone is nice and the feel is comfortable. Fret buzzing is minimal and with the few adjustments I made it might even hold its own on a gig. The first thing I did was change the factory strings to some better grade Flat-Wounds and that helped a lot.\\nThe Amp that comes with this kit is really cool too. It has a 4 band equalizer for highs, lows, hi-mids, and low mids. I gets to a nice volume for \"bedroom practice\" but I would not blast it for sake of the speaker. Getting BOTH this amp and the bass itself for this price is a bargain.\\nThe only reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is still a beginners guitar. This is OK to start learning on but if you want to be a \"Bass Player\" you will want to get something better down the road.\\nAll and all this is a solid product and I would recommend it for any beginner.', 'The old saying you get what you pay for. Well for what we paid this is a great package deal. Sounds good, not hard to play. Where else could you get all of these items for such a great price. It gives you the opportunity to see if this is an instrument you are interested in.', \"I'm not a mic cable connoisseur but so far these cables are working great! Arrived quickly and are delivering quality sound so far!\", 'Got this because of the price and to see if teen-ager needing direction could figure it out enough to fill out our little friends and family band. Out of the carton, tuned right up and has enough thump for performances in small bars where we play. Don\\'t know how they can sell them this cheap, but this thing rivals much, much, much pricier bass guitars for playability and sound - even with the small amp which, even more amazingly, is included along with patch cord, tuner, picks and learner-CD for the amazing price. This one impressed me and the story blows away people who hear us perform (Of course our music is very good!!).  And the kid - already a great drummer and with a pretty good ear for picking stuff out on piano - picked up the bass rhythm after just a few hours of practice on this thing. One of the best \"impulse\" buys I\\'ve ever made.', 'i bought this bass with a gift certificate and used super savr shipping and it was at my door in 2 days!!\\nit was great right out of the box!!  it needed a bit of adjusting but thats not a big deal. the amp works but is not very loud. but its only 10 watts so what would you expect.  the amp looks and feels very sturdy and the guitar does too. ive been playing guitar for 30 years and have played a bass only a few times and just wanted something to fool around with and this is perfect.\\nim extremely happy with this and i think its well worth more than the 168 that i paid for it.\\ni highly recomend this bass.', \"I love this package! I have been playing electric guitar for quite a while, but I wanted to try the bass. But I did not want to pay too much since I did not know if I would like it. I found this package being sold by American Music Outlet for less $ than the bass can be bought without the amp elsewhere. The guitar is beautifully finished, and was well set up. (I got the sunburst.) To me it sounds good as well. The amp is sufficient for practice. The bag is NOT padded, but if you are careful it can be useful for transporting the guitar. Other than the unpadded bag I got exactly what was promised. I have owned a Silvertone Les Paul guitar for a couple of years and have had no problems with it, so I expect this bass will be of similar quality. I haven't been playing the Les Paul much since I got the bass; I am always playing the bass. If you have not already been playing some sort of guitar, you might need more instruction than is provided by the DVD included in this package. I have been playing mostly by ear and am having a great time.\", 'If you\\'re looking at this starter set, you\\'re probably in a similar position as I was.  And you\\'re looking to start playing bass guitar, but aren\\'t so self-assured or financially inclined that you\\'re looking to spend a lot of money on a beginning instrument.  Which brings you to starter sets in the first place.  You want everything you need at a good price while not sacrificing playability.  And to me: that\\'s exactly what this set is.\\n\\nThe bass itself is quite nice, exceeding my expectations.  Any pictures you find online usually wash out the shine and make the color look flat and boring.  But it\\'s a pretty striking, deep, shiny black.  It\\'s not a $1000 bass, but it looks way nicer than the price would make you think it does.  As for sound, I\\'ve never played a bass before, so I have nothing to compare it to.  However, the amp brings the sound through pretty cleanly and warmly.  And I really have no complaints.\\n\\nThe thumb rest on the bass just seemed to detract from the aesthetic appeal, and got in my way when moving down a string.  I find it\\'s just as easy to rest your thumb on the pickup when playing the E string.  Although it can be removed easily and in short order with an average-sized Phillips screwdriver, it leaves kind of unsightly screw holes behind, that had low-laying, somewhat jagged edges.  I filed that down carefully with some sandpaper, and it\\'s now fine.  If there\\'s anything I have against the bass, it\\'s the thumb rest.  Since it\\'s removable, it\\'s really no big deal.  Just making note of it.\\n\\nRegarding accessories:\\nThe case is, as others have said, not capable of protecting against anything except scratches or dust.  It\\'s better than nothing, but the bottom-mounted zipper makes casing and uncasing awkward and slow, and I always worry about the fabric pulling on one of the tuning keys and untuning it.\\n\\nThe picks are picks.  Rounded, triangular pieces of plastic.  I haven\\'t used them, because I\\'ve preferred finger-plucking so far.  Feels way more assured and direct, plus I find it easier to mute strings with the pick not in the way.  But they\\'re a nice addition, for those that want them.\\n\\nThe strap is extremely simple.  It feels somewhat cheaply made and thin, but it will suffice, temporarily.  Just like the case, eventually you\\'ll probably want another, better one.\\n\\nThe tuner feels kind of lightweight and flimsy, but it seems to work okay.  I have no thoughts that it will break soon unless I\\'m rough with it.\\n\\nThe DVD was a nice addition, and did teach me a little.  But most of the material can be absorbed in a single viewing, and probably figured out completely in three or four.  It\\'s also quite short.  Also a nice addition (and includes electric and acoustic guitar sections) but you will want more books, DVDs, a teacher, or all of the above to really get onto learning the bass.\\n\\nThe bass guitar had been on my sizable list of \"Instruments to try out, eventually...\" for some time, but upon starting the anime series Beck (which any rock fan would love, regardless of age or thoughts toward Japanese animation) I realized it was simply time to start.  And I don\\'t think I could have picked a better starter set for the price.  I\\'ve only had this thing for a day, but currently I\\'m 100% satisfied.  Shipping was super-quick, too.  I\\'ll add to this review if anything breaks.\\n\\nNow if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'d like to continue practicing...', 'works well and set up is easy', 'The cables are basic XLR connections.  Pretty much as described very thin.  They work fine though and I would buy again.', 'shure never lets down! great cables', 'I always prefer getting Shure cables to use with a Shure microphone; this is high quality cable. I rate this a five star product.', 'First, although K240 phones old and new surround your ears, they are vented.  Ambient noise is not reduced greatly as a result, but this design improves sound quality.\\n\\nI have used the 600 ohm K240M phones since 1986.  The new K240S are 55 ohms making them far more compatible with todays lower voltage gear.  Even better, this new design gives deep bass response that I never thought was possible from phones.  Even a 32 foot bombarde pipe organ stop sounds quite real, although you will not feel the room shake.  Listening to a signal generator through these new K240S phones gives an impression of powerful bass down to at least 40 Hz.  The old K240M drops off below 100 Hz.  A slight dip in the midrange(K240M) has been filled in, making the K240S more true sounding.\\n\\nBoth the new and old versions reproduce operatic voices without increased \"ping\" which can be very abrasive.  Years ago I started using phones to judge voices on choral recordings, resorting to speakers only to judge the organ sound.  Speakers can make some beautiful voices sound nasty.  Producer John Culshaw documented this in one of his books on recording the Wagner Ring.\\n\\nThe open air design minimizes ear sweating while giving a more open perspective.  \"In your head\" effects are greatly suppressed compared to many sealed type phones.  When watching opera DVD I find no conflict between the phone perspective and the TV screen on DVD that are well mixed.  Orchestral sound is excellent, as is piano.  To my ears, these phones give a perspective and tonal balance that is very close to what I hear at Boston Symphony Hall, when I sit in the second balcony front.  These seats overhang the stage.  When I sing in a choir, the live perspective is even closer to what the phones produce, provided my position on stage is fairly central.  This is, in my opinion, a valid sound perspective, even if it is quite different from the tenth row center sound I aim for when I build speakers.  Non performers sometimes have trouble accepting this close a perspective at first, only because it is not familiar.  Many other phones give a perspective that is too close for comfort, a good reason to avoid the low end.\\n\\nIt is good to bear in mind that individual ears are unique in shape and that phones are designed to work on a \"standard ear\" made with an average shape.  Phones will give different response curves depending on how your ear pinnae and canal differs from that \"laboratory standard ear\" shape.\\n\\nPeople with small heads will have trouble keeping the phones on.  It is unfortunate that although this problem has been known for years, nothing has been done to correct this.\\n\\nAKG did not change any parts that touch your ears and head, a very wise move.  Some parts are interchangeble, as they have the same stock number on AKG parts lists.  Unfortunately AKG has of late been hard to deal with, making part purchases difficult.\\n\\nConsider buying the K 240 studio phones in the MK II version as you get a spare cord and spare ear pads with a velvet like feel. Having these extra parts on hand is worth the extra cost and makes this four star item a 5 star item.', \"Not that comfortable, to me. The inner part of the phones touch my ear lobes, which I do not expect and have not usually experienced with other brands like Bose or AKG. These are, however, renowned for studio use because they allow a lot of sound in from the room while providing you with clear, neutral feedback on what you are recording or putting out there. They are not particularly good, however, for music, if you like bass thumbing cans. These ain't them. They are super flat (which is what they are designed to be).\", \"Every headphone has a sound, as an imperfect medium compared to our ears.  And this one can pull apart the tendrils of classical music well.  The lack of bass is really a perception, as most headphones I've heard like to warm up the lower-mid's to thicken the sauce of the music, but that of course can muddy music that needs some clarity.  I suppose with the 'neutral' bass, though, it is a little less engaging than other 'phones.  Like when I listen to a jazz combo, it's clean but the upright bass has lost its kick--again, compared to other headphones.  This gets so close to the pair of Stax headphones I have, which are so good.. and $700.  just a little less engaged than the stax, which I guess does make a difference over time.  whereas I would listen to the stax for hours, this maybe 30-45 min.  I am using it to monitor my keyboard work, where I have to hear differences between various historical models of piano on my laptop; each note comes off the way it should, not warmed up as I mentioned.  the Fidelio x2's were more of a fun headphone that I still found clear-sounding, but they are double the price.  and the hifiman or course is good, but double again the price.  whew!\", 'Probably the best headphones for sound quality under $100.', 'Not satisfied the product did not work. The sound keeps cracking.', \"These are perfect headphones for almost anyone. I'm an audio engineer for a living, both live and studio. For the money I don't think there's anything that can touch these for accuracy. They are true over-rated headphones even for someone with larger ears. I love that the cable unplug from the headphones with a mini-XLR connector... it's always the cable that gets messed up with headphones and this one simply disconnects for transport, and can be replaced.\\nThey do not fold up compact like some headphones do. They're large. Also, they don't noise cancel much. If you do live concert sound and need isolation from noise I'd recommend the Sennheiser HD280 Pro.

I am so crazy about them.  I have been using them to listen to movies and music on my laptop and I get completely immersed in what is playing.  The sounds are all well defined and crystal clear.

They aren't super comfortable but they are not uncomfortable.  You almost forget they're are there which is a good thing.  The only reason I didn't give these five stars is because of the feel.  The price was right for what I needed and I'm very happy.  I haven't used them for causal listening but that's not really what I bought them for.  I have some LSTN headphones that I really like for leisure music listening but those are too scewed towards lower frequencies to reliably mix anything even when doing a rough mix.\", 'I\\'ve been reading a lot of very positive reviews for these headphones, so I bought a pair to add to my collection.  I\\'m a huge fan of AKG microphones, so I\\'ve been excited to hear what they\\'re doing with their headphones.  As it turns out, they\\'re good, but not great.\\n\\nHigh frequencies are a little too loud and more harsh than I\\'d expect for a set of headphones in this class.  This really causes many of the artifacts caused by MP3 encoding to be over-emphasized.  Instead of being smooth and silky they are a bit cutting and shimmery.  If I was to listen to these at anything over a moderate volume level for long my ears would fatigue rather quickly.  That boost does occasionally help certain types of music, though.  For example, as I\\'m writing this I\\'m listening to Lindsey Stirling\\'s \"Elements\" and the high frequency boost makes it easier to hear some of what one of the synth parts is doing compared to other headphones.  But on other tracks it is distracting and unpleasant.  Demi Lovato\\'s voice, for example, is a little grating on these headphones while perfectly fine on others.\\n\\nThe low end is a bit of a mixed bag.  There seems to be a bit of a boost right around 100 Hz but everything below that is definitely quieter than they ought to be.  The 100-Hz boost is probably why some feel like they have more bass they really do.  But below that they are definitely a little thin and lacking.  They are capable of producing really low frequencies, but they just aren\\'t very loud when doing so.\\n\\nThe mid-range is also a bit weak.  Vocals seem more distant than they should, especially in comparison to the sibilants which are in your face (again, this is why it is hard for me to listen to Demi Lovato).  There is also a little bit of unwanted honkiness between 1kHz and 1.5kHz as well.  Not bad, but they definitely aren\\'t producing a flat response through the mids.\\n\\nCompared to my other headphones these are a lot quieter than other models.  I have to turn up the volume nearly all the way on my MP3 player to get sufficient volume.  My other headphones play at comfortable volumes with the player\\'s volume control at half of what is required for the K240s.\\n\\nIn comparison to the Sony MDR-V6 or MDR-7506 these aren\\'t nearly as good.  At least not if you\\'re talking about accurate reproduction of sound.  The Sonys are much flatter (as in, more accurate, not dull), which means they are both easier and more enjoyable to listen to.\\n\\nRelative to the Grado SR80e, the Grados definitely have a huge edge over the AKGs.  The SR80e model doesn\\'t have the same aural deficiencies.  But they do rest directly on your ears, which some people may not like.\\n\\nThey do blow away any <$150 Sennheisers though.  I still haven\\'t figured out why anyone likes the modestly priced Sennheiser headphones.  They all sound awful.\\n\\nAll in all, these probably are better than any pair of headphones that most people will ever listen to.  But for the money you can do better.  I\\'d take them over pretty much anything less than $50 for sure, but for just a couple bucks more you can get the amazing MDR-V6 if you are okay with closed backs, or Grado SR80e if you prefer something more open.', \"SOUND -\\n\\nFlat frequency response without being entirely lifeless. Clear instrument separation regardless of the relatively minuscule soundstage compared to other open headphones. Again, very flat frequency response and good for mixing - though actual accuracy is a tad underwhelming. For actually listening, the mids are a tad too powerful by comparison to the low end for my taste - and I am by no means a basshead - but it can lead to some over-sibilant vocals and harsh cymbals overtaking the high end. It would be inappropriate to say that they're not top of the line for the price you pay though, as I'm truly nitpicking and wouldn't have expected them to sound any better.\\n\\nBUILD -\\n\\nWell, they're certainly lightweight. This comes at a cost though, as they're flimsy and cheaply constructed. Again, not unexpected for the price paid and honestly I'd rather have better sound than build at this price point. If you expect to really beat them up though, they'll most likely not appreciate it from a structural standpoint.\\n\\nVALUE -\\n\\nGreat, but not exceptional. You'd be hard pressed to find something better under $100, but there are certainly better headphones for listening and even mixing at a slightly less tight budget.\", 'Best sound for the money', \"The sound is not as nice as my friends older original k240's. In fact I am not happy at all with these. The highs are slightly reed like and the lows are just not there. Well they are there but lacking the tone and depth of my other headphones. I'll break them in a little and see if that helps.\", 'Good product, just as described', 'Pretty decent pair of headphones for the price.  Good sound quality but not fantastic.  Would recommend for a casual listener.', \"Quality audio from my Laserdisc classical CD collection has never sounded so nice as it has with these new headphones. TWiT.TV uses these in their production, so that was certainly a plus and helped me to seal the purchase (as once you get into studio monitor quality headphones, they become harder to distinguish between them).\\n\\nThe EQ on these headphones is a flat one, unlike regular consumer headsets that focus extensively on bass (even some 'gaming' headsets have high focus on bass response to the detriment of music listening).\\n\\nAccording to TWiT.TV, these are studio quality headphones meant for playback and are designed to be used in production of media. I wholeheartedly agree and also state that these are well made and fit me well.\\n\\nI started looking at studio quality headsets when I discovered that my Steelseries gaming headset was starting the die (the cord was, once again, causing loss of sound in one ear piece and the microphone no longer worked). I would have normally stayed with the steelseries and bought a new one, but then I looked at the price for a v1 headset - it has not gone down once in the four years I have owned this model (actually a replacement for the same model) and remains at $60 or so. A new v2 headset is even more expensive and still has the same problems (non-removable cord, internal mic included, which is rather tiny).\\n\\nI decided the best way to solve this problem and to avoid having to buy new headphones every couple of years (at $60 per headphone, too!) was to separate the microphone from the headset (get a headset with no internal mic) and focus on headsets that promote removable cords (as at that point replacement cords can be had cheaply, rather than replacing the whole setup).\\n\\nAs I have heard, AKG is not a well-known brand of studio quality headsets (here in Amercia, Sony-brand studio monitors and alike are the norm in productions that I have observed) but my quality assessment of these is that they sound GREAT.\\nThe price was just right, only a few dollars more than a replacement headset, and the specs are even better looking than my old gaming headset. These are semi-open headphones, so others may be able to hear what you're listening to - but I usually run my computers at 21 volume because I have sensitive ears (I hate loud volume, unlike every one else in my family who are all 100-volume users).\\n\\nMy experience is that I can not hear the music from any distance with these headphones at the usual 21 volume. The bass and treble are all perfectly natural and the virtual stage (a 2.0 setup) makes sounds in the music more clear than they ever were with my old headset. I can pick out the individual instruments in the classical music easily with these headphones, whereas before they were all meshed together because of the massive bass boost on the older gaming headset.\\n\\nI am highly satisfied with my purchase and will definitely buy from this brand again, should I need to.\", \"I used these headphones in my small guitar studio for a very short time. Headphones are a useful tool for guitarists when trying to learn solos by ear. These headphones are useless for this particular application. They are mushy with little definition and they clip easily,  even when pulling out the lower frequencies and operating at a reasonable volume. I ended up giving them to my 18 year old daughter hoping that she would have better luck than I. Eventually I ended up going with the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x and I couldn't be happier.\", 'nice quality, sounds great, and consumer price friendly.  many thanks, jim', 'These are great studio headphones!  They sound true, and comfort is excellent!', \"These headphones were specifically recommended to me by my audio engineering professor- they have great frequency response, are comfortable for long periods of time, and sound just as good as the more expensive studio model.

I found myself putting levels higher and higher. Until, I noticed that the master track was clipping significantly. I hooked up the iPhone head phones and right away, I could hear the volume difference. I am assuming that I will need a head phone amp/mixer to make levels higher but, I was totally not expecting that from these studio quality head phones.

Kudos to AKG!!', 'Very disappointed with bass. I\\'m no \"basshead\". I love all kinds of music from popular to acoustic to classical.  The bass in the AKG K240 drops off severely below 50 Hz and is nearly inaudible at 30 Hz even though the product description claims 15 Hz.  Any attempt to boost the bass will result in fluttering sounds of driver excursion. I personally prefer to leave my music source flat and I don\\'t like using bass boost, but I want to hear natural sounding clear and sufficiently loud bass.\\n\\nHere\\'s a spectral plot analysis of the acoustic music video \"It\\'s Time\" from \"Imagine Dragons\". http://bit.ly/1nbufm8\\n\\nEven though it\\'s acoustic music (they don\\'t even use true bass instruments), there\\'s a lot of music between 30 and 70 Hz.  So contrary to the opinions of music elitists who frown at \"bassheads\" and the bass heavy products, we really do need good bass reproduction for all sorts of music.  What the elitists who give this product a high rating call \"flat\" or \"neutral\" is misleading.  Flat should mean the frequency response is flat throughout the music frequency spectrum.\\n\\nAll that said, I will say that I like the build quality and the detachable cable.', 'I bought my first pair of these AKGs sometime from 1975 to 1978, and loved them.  Used them for about 15 years until they were damaged in a mishap.  I\\'ve had other \\'phones since then, most notably the Nakamichi SP-7, but none I liked as much as that old pair from the past.  So when I saw that they were either still - or once again - available (and on sale) I had to get a pair especially since I\\'m using headphones a lot lately.  I just had to know whether they were as good as I recalled.\\n\\nThey are better.  Improved, I guess.  They still look, feel and fit the same - and that\\'s a good thing.  The bass is deep and well-defined, not artificially boosted but can thump with the best when a thump is on the recording(Gov\\'t Mule\\'s \"Lay Your Burden Down\").  Highs are clean and well-extended - certainly they go higher than my 10khz cutoff hearing - younger folks who\\'ve passed through like the highs.  Mids sound good, with virtually none of the congestion you can get with lesser \\'phones or speakers.  As the mids become more complex due to multiple instruments, its easy to follow just one (for instance cello in several quartets I sampled).\\n\\nDynamics are great, as heard in Glenn Miller Orchestra, \"In the Digital Mood,\"  \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\" track, and the Tchaikovsky \"1812 Overture\" in this case on Telarc.  With movies, explosions can be startling.\\n\\nIn addition to sound quality, these headphones are also superlative in other ways.  One is the way they fit.  Yes, they are pretty large, but the large cups fit around the ear and press against the skull, which reduces ear soreness to virtually none.  The gimbal construction, which auto adjusts when simply put on the head has always been a strong point of this headphone.  I can wear them for hours with no ear soreness.\\n\\nAlso, fit and finish is excellent - AKG have obviously kept QC standards up despite having these made now in China.  Connections are first-rate, and the cable enters at the Left earcup as the good Lord intended.  I love the compactness and fit of the screw-on 1/4\" plug (an adaptor that fits over the 1/8\" - 3.5mm - plug).\\n\\nThe one area in which the headphone does not excel is isolation, but that is to be expected with an open (they call it semi-open) type cup construction.  On the other hand, it is extremely difficult to attain this level of sonic excellence in a closed-back design.  I\\'ve heard none, if they exist, but even if there is one I\\'m sure it would be much more pricey.  Generally, one just expects to give up the \"airy\" sound of an open design with a closed headphone, so it depends on the importance of isolation to the listener.  I have a pair of closed-backs to use when needed, but most of the time I\\'ll be using these.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying these are perfect, but they are as close as I\\'ll get, since I certainly won\\'t spend more than a c-note on headphones - it just wouldn\\'t be prudent.  I pushed my own limits to get these at just less than seventy bucks, and I\\'m darned glad that I did.  My opinion then is obvious - best at the price, and better than many to which I\\'ve listened in the past that were much more expensive.', \"Wanted a good pair of studio MIXING headphones. These are NOT. They sound and feel like the cheap headphones I got at Ross on a whim for 12 bucks. When they say these are flat, they mean that NO FREQUENCY is very well represented. I am still looking for a good pair of mixing headphones, and have decided to go to a music store and try a bunch first.\\n\\nNOTE: the Sony MDR 7506 are not the answer: they have NO BASS, very tinny, and the ear pads will rot within months whether you use them or not.  Again, they have NO BASS so you'll end up putting too much bass in your mix. Also, the leakage is bad, so you can't use them to track. Kind of useless headphones.\\n\\nI realize you are not supposed to mix entirely on headphones, but I'd like some that are flat and decent.

No technical talk for those that understand great specs do not always mean great headphones.  These do have great specs, by the way.\\n\\nI have a pair of older 240s that are 600 ohms.  These are essentially the same except they are 55 ohms.  So, it takes less power to drive them.  What that means is that if you use a low output device (phone, computer, etc.) you will get more volume.  The volume is considerably louder than the older 240s and most studio reference headphones.  However, they are not nearly as loud as headphones designed specifically for portable devices.  All that said, they sound great with my Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Tab Pro.  You do not need a separate headphone amp.  Normal people do not use headphone amps.  I dont; know why everyone always talks about them.  No amp needed.  If you are using these with mixing board or plunging them into an old-fashioned stereo, you certainly do not need an amp. they are loud.  With a portable device they are louder than most people would need.  but again, not as loud as something designed for a portable device.\\n\\nAs far as sound, these are some of the best sounding headphones I have tried.  The sound is flat - like it should be.  All sounds, highs, mids, and lows, come through crystal clear.  Unless you want to spend several hundreds of dollars more, I really haven;'t heard anything even close to the 240s.  Cranked up, they handle loud volume without distorting.\\n\\nAs far a comfort, these are the single most comfortable headphones ever made.  Period!  They are circumaural, which means they fit completely around your ear.  They completely go around your ear (at least my ear) without any on-ear pressure.  They are light weight and the adjustable band literally makes them weightless.  Within a few minutes you will forget they are on.  I watched a movie on my computer and had these on for about 2 1/2 hours.  There was no strain or pressure anywhere.  My ears and the top of my head didn't feel anything.\\n\\nThe 240s also have a detachable replaceable cord. this is abig plus as cords are the things which seem to go bad before anything else.\\n\\nI realize sound preferences and fit are completely subjective.  For me they are the best phones I have ever owned.  For sound and comfort the AKG 240 Studio headphones are as good a it gets.\", \"Solid performers that look cool and feel comfortable, and a nice flat response- critical if you're using these to mix tracks or audio engineering. If you're looking for a pair to jam out to music, again, the audio quality is clear and great, just flat. So bass will be lacking.\\n\\nI just purchased a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50's and they seem better sounding with a fuller spectrum, at least to my eyes. Better bass in the M50s too, but not overly boosted like Beats headphones.\\n\\nOverall though, these are a great pair which will remain in my studio.\", \"Can't beat AKG's , especially for recording.  My old pair gave out after some 15 years of use, and unintentional abuse, so,  I just bought new one's...\", 'More of a design thing but not for vocal recording you can clearly hear the sound coming out of these right in your mic.', 'Awesome headphones, enough said!', 'When I researched headphones (in general) I looked at all aspects: quality, sound, makers, and in particular - comfort. I really just wanted a decent pair of them, and so I put my time in and \"experienced\" just about every pair available at a local (large) showroom. I tried the $500 pairs and the middle roads, and the cheapies...and frankly, they all fit and sounded (to me) roughly the same. I certainly expected a lot more for $500 is what I am really saying here, (like maybe seeing earth from orbit. I mean - $500? Are you effing kidding me?). In any case, I was unimpressed.\\n\\nSo. I read more reviews and decided to try these, it said \"Studio\" headphones, I assumed long periods of use and comfort when I first put them on. But again, I was unimpressed, they mashed my head and ears like I had a head mashing machine installed. But with some tweaking, they have grown on me quite a bit.\\n\\nSound. So far these seem decent enough, and overall quality is pretty good. Certainly no worse than the $500 ones, comparatively speaking. Far better quality than the $30 cheapies, certainly. I\\'d say they are about par with everything else I tried over $50-$60. Maybe the Wilkens/Bowers were a bit more comfy. But not for $500. Yet, the clarity of sound from these K240\\'s seem about the same. Of course, that is from memory, not side-by-side.\\n\\nComfort: What I now grasp is that I didn\\'t consider that ears in ones youth can hear frequencies I (now older) do not, and that \"comfortable\" is often pure subjective opinion (apparently). So, many headphone reviews (amazon professional or otherwise) for me then became pure BS. What I mean here is these (like every other pair I have owned) just didn\\'t fit me that well when they arrived - my ears touched the interior headphone walls. This colored my initial opinions considerably.\\n\\nThing is, I have ears that stick out a bit. Some research revealed the same exact (unsurprising) attitudes of other headphone owners, and - they \"MODDED out the problem.\" Some people will go to lengthy repair efforts, others just go simple/cheap. It struck me while standing looking in the mirror I already HAD a solution...using similar steps.\\n\\nTweaks: What some folks do is stuff cotton under the ear pads to lift the pads up a bit, away from the ears. Using cotton supposedly stiffens the pads up a bit, but the results are worth it. My adapted solution was close, and reusable.\\n\\nI used 8 memory foam earplugs stuffed under the earpads (4 per ear side, top, bottom, left/right under the pads.) Best part is cotton doesn\\'t reshape, where memory foam does...and pulling in or pushing them out a bit makes for easy adjustments.\\n\\nAnd it works for any \"over the ear\" that have ear pads that lift up on the inside.\\n\\nThe other thing is that those \"bars\" that run over the top of the headband are actually wires coated in plastic, not just plastic. They can be bent and flattened out some for better comfort if your head is getting squeezed, just be a bit careful and take your time to get good results.\\n\\nLastly, some Velcro can be used to add some soft foam to the underside of of the headband (doesn\\'t have any) easily enough. Total tweaks cost - about $10 or so.\\n\\nNow they are FAR more comfortable. Wish I had tried that out when I owned my old Beyers.\\n\\nSo, while my opinion of these were of returning them when I first got them, I no longer feel that way. Some tweaking helped quite a bit. I have also read that headphones usually \"improve\" with some \"burn-in\", and while I do not know if that is true, I do like the sound better now that I did when I first tried them on. I initially had the opinion of returning them, but with some comfort tweaking I decided I am going to keep them.', \"Long story short - the retro design looks great, and they sound really good for quieter settings and mellow music.  The sound is clear and good at moderate levels, but these are not designed to be cranked.  They're not good for loud rock, which is what I listen to mostly, but in quiet times with mellow music they are very good.  They are bulky with the older design, which was something I liked online but not when I put them on.  As an added bonus, you can remove the wire and dress up and look classy for your next steampunk party.\", \"When I bought this product I was expecting a lot from it as I have Harman/Kardon laptop speakers (AKG is a Harman company) which are absolutely amazing when it comes to sound quality. I bought this intending on buying a pair of headphones that would be able to provide good amounts of bass without compromising sound quality, but this didn't do that at all. When I 1st listened to them it sounded like the bass was replaced with treble, it was an indescribable experience and was horrible. As I burned it in for an hour it sounded much better in terms of sound quality, but there was very little bass. The overall sound quality was actually less than that of my laptop's speakers believe it or not, which makes these only worth about $60 at most. The build quality was a bit sketchy which is surprising having seen how they make these on How It's Made. If you're looking for cheap headphones with good sound quality these may do it for you, but you can find better elsewhere.\", \"ear pads are cheap thin plastic, not like the old ones. head band is also made of stiff thin plastic, unlike the old ones. theme here ?  sound is ok for voice and hearing whats going on, but again not as good as the old ones. they really do seem like $20-$30 pair, not what they are charging. all the money of went into the TA3 connectors to make the cable easy to replace.  the upside is they are light and reasonably comfortable for open ear design. not for critical use where isolation is needed like field audio recording, then the HD280's are the best price / performer hands down.\", \"I'm not that old, but i knew good quality when i was a kid. i bought a pair of Austrian made in my early teens.

Also I can listen to music for hours and hours on them because they are so non-fatiguing: marvelously balanced and even have a slight treble roll-off, which is fine for someone getting on in years like me who\\'s probably already lost a bit of the higher frequency hearing (above 15KHz).  The Grados on the other hand are impressive when you first plug them in because they are rather \"hot\"---the highest and lowest frequencies seem to be accentuated, which makes them kind of \"fun\" headphones especially if you listen to a lot of bass-heavy and/or high-tempo pop/dance or hard rock type music.\\n\\nThe AKGs are particularly exquisite if you are into midrange-dominant music like jazz, classical, or vocal music: instruments and voices come across with remarkable realism in tonality and timbre, and quickly become very addictive.  Whereas on the Grados the midrange seemed rather thin and recessed, and overshadowed by the treble and bass.\\n\\nSo really, it all depends on your preferences.  The physical comfort of the AKGs is less subjective, however: they are easily the most comfortable over-the-ear phones I\\'ve ever tried.  This is a HUGE factor worth considering.\\n\\n4 and 1/2 stars: 1/2 star deduction for the vinyl-covered earpads heating up my head, but I probably should\\'ve ordered the K240 Mk 2 version which come swith the velour earpads instead...kind of wish they had come with more breathable foam earpads like the Grados instead, but I imagine AKG chose not to because these insulate the sound better and form a better seal which allows for more bass.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, you\\'d have to be a total BASS-HEAD to say that these babies don\\'t put out enough bass...I find them to have MORE than adequate bass, and it\\'s nice tight accurate bass not the sloppy boomy kind that teenagers are generally used to and have blaring out of their cheesy car subwoofers.\\n\\nLast point: sound leakage with this \"semi-open\" design was far less than anticipated.  You can only hear the music if blasting it; at casual/comfortable listening levels they were fine...I tried it out in a public library.  Certainly far less leakage than the Grados.  Haven\\'t tried them out in a noisy environment yet to see how their sound isolation compares to my in-ear headphones, but that\\'s not a fair fight anyway...I probably wouldn\\'t recommend taking these with you on a flight!', 'Im very happy with AKG headphones, this is my second set of AKG headphones they the sound is great!! Thank you.', \"Okay, I'm a little bias for AKG.  I already have the AKG Q701, which I use daily and for hours at a time.  The sound is good, but not as good as the Q701, but then I wouldn't expect it to.  These are semi-open, so it's not going to completely block the outside noise, or keep your music from leaking.  The bass is shy and the highs rather harsh, but its still a good entry level headphone for less than $100.\", 'Sound quality is subjective, so I won\\'t say much about it. To me they sound great, as good as my M-Audio studio monitors. I\\'ve powered them from a Scarlett 2i2 and an internal laptop soundcard, both drive them at a fine volume. My android phone (Samsung Vibrant) is a little on the quiet side, but still usable.\\n\\nThey are very comfortable. The cushions are nice and soft, and fit over my ears completely. The auto-adjusting headband feels great. They don\\'t fit quite as snug as I\\'d like, but they are secure on my head.\\n\\nThey feel solid, and can be wrenched around pretty good and retain their shape. I like the fact that the cord is detachable, and can be replaced if damaged. I also like the screw-on 1/4\" adapter, which is nice and secure.\\n\\nI wanted the mkII version, as they come with a second set of cushions (velvet) and coiled cable. I feel like the velvet cushions would be less prone to sweat, and I much prefer coiled cables as they don\\'t twist, and are good space-wise. I couldn\\'t justify the price difference though.\\n\\nIf the price difference drops to where the mkII isn\\'t much more (say $10-$15 or so) I\\'d go with those. Same headphones, more bonuses. If you don\\'t like coiled cables or velvet cushions, these are just as good.', \"Man I had to repurchase these AKG'S they are killer phones!!! I am in an extensive recording program at my school and the right headphones are essential to the labs there and let me say that they are absolutely superb.  Someone stole the first pair I had, and I rarely repurchase the same item twice but these were definitely worth the reinvestment.  True sound, ultra clear highs and low end without distortion.  I'd recommend these, and they cover your entire ear, I know it says semi open but it covers the entire ear and they are super comfortable too.  Hope this helps\", \"i'm a tough critic.  I always read the bad reviews, but with caution but I want to know the real deal.  So I decided to retire my 1992 240 AKG's.  Twenty years of dailly use.  The cable is shot.\\nDown to the wires, just a matter of time before I step on the cable in the dark and they are gone.  Time to update.  Decided on these cuz I Love AKG, best studio heads I know.\\ncan listen all day without fatigue.  These have a mini plug, my video cameras need them. I hate most adaptors.  Mini has become more standard.  Zoom uses it.  So I got my order yesturday and tired them. A/Bed them to the older headphones.  Much more dynamic range.  I was surprized.  Spent about twenty minutes comparing, then packed away the 92 versions.\\nThese are good low level Pro headphones.  I'm happy.  I'm seldom happy with products cuz most so called pro stuff is really consumer plus or kids in garages.  See my review on JBL small computer speaker for some advice.\\nI'll live with these and when I get some cash, buy some high end AKGs.  I like what i hear.  May not be top of line but my audio and music sound good.\", \"I've owned and used AKG K240s (and the discontinued K240DF) for more than a decade.  The quality of the product has fallen CONSIDERABLY since manufacturing moved to China.  To be truthful, this was never a particularly durable headset, but the old models made in Europe were head and shoulders above what AKG is shipping now.  They feel flimsy coming out of the box, and the product I received has a poor solder connection internally that makes the right channel audio cut out when you turn your head.  The plastic ear cup is already partially cracked and I've used them for just two months in studio.  The ear padding isn't as soft or comfortable as the old model, either.\\n\\nSonically, they are everything I'd like my headphones to be, but that doesn't matter when I can only hear in one ear. I won't be buying AKG headphones again in the near future.\", 'my original review: \"relatively flat, super comfortable, and a bargain at around $100. plus, the cord is detachable, should it fail. all around, a great product.\"\\n\\nwell, the left channel stopped working last week. i thought it might be the cable, so i ordered a replacement. no luck; it\\'s the headphones. a google search found that this is a common problem with these headphones. so be aware.', \"I was an audiophile in the past. Now, interested in doing. I wanted to hear recordings accurately. Went with these based on review and reputation. I'm very happy I did. These are excellent, outstanding, accurate. Every bit of praise from others is correct. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.\", 'If you are after that \"thump-thump\" kind of exaggerated sound don\\'t buy these. The K240 headphones are \"accurate\" and don\\'t add anything to the sound.  People who are mixing or editing sound prefer \"accurate\" but many music listeners prefer the accentuated bass.  These headphones let you hear what is on the track an add nothing to that.  The sound is transparent, as if you were not wearing headphones.  Also being \"semi-open\" this means they do not block sound in either direction.  This open design adds to the not-wearing-headphones sound but is not practical in some settings.  Remember these are STUDIO headphones.  They provide accurate sound for engineers and are best used in a quiet studio setting.  If you are a music listener at home then the best use of these headphones is for classical or jazz in a quiet living room.  or for critical listening to any music, for example recently I was trying to listen to Paul McCarney\\'s bass guitar lines in some new and old recordings. With these I can hear every note and also how he played the strings with his fingers.  The K240 provide an accurate, reserved sound for that kind of listening, not the popular flashy and thumpy sound.\\n\\nSerious headphone users will find they need several pair but one pair should be these.', \"I bought these about 3 years ago to replace the K240M that I had. The K240M had several issues - its 600 ohms impedance, and the non-replaceable cable.\\n\\nFor some reason, my cats love AKG headphones and kept chewing the cord.\\nThis K240s was a godsend . I bought them and 5 replacement cords. I'm down to the last one. I keep forgetting to pack them in my drawer after use.\\n\\nI have hundreds of cables in my house between my computer, home theater, home recording studio, and my cats only chew these, for some reason.\\n\\nAlso, the sound quality is insanely great and accurate. I have been using these recently to monitor recordings . These are more revealing than any speakers ever will be. Last saturday I recorded a harpsichord. I had 2 pairs hooked up to the recording station, including these. The other was a Sony 700DJ heapdhone. The Sony's sounded really dead. Like something was off. Too much bass, not enough treble. There was no mistaking the accuracy of the playback of the AKG, since I was sitting right next to the instrument and performer. It was almost like the real thing.\\n\\nI see that these have dropped quite a bit in price since I bought them. At this price I might just have to get a second pair.\", \"Edit: 12/2012\\n\\nI no longer recommend these headphones, I feel the sound and build quality have suffered since the move to building them in China. They are still a decent buy, and I can't recommend another semi-open in this price range, but the closed offerings in the bracket are MUCH better options in my opinion. I'm talking about the usual suspects the MDR-7506 and ATH-M50 are my two favorites.\\n\\n----- Back to 2008 -----\\n\\nThese are considered the studio standard in circumaural open back headphones for good reason. The sound reproduction is excellent, with clear bass and midrange and a very balanced profile through the entire frequency spectrum. It makes me angry at how much I've spent on speakers and studio monitors, these do a better job at a fraction of the price.\\n\\nThey are circumaural they fit OVER your ears. I guess some people don't like that. I think they might change their mind if they tried these. If you're looking for a SUPRA-aural design look at the AKG K141\\n\\nI find them extremely comfortable. I have literally forgotten I was wearing them more than once. The suspension system adjusts automagically and is excellent. At first I felt a little unsure about the security of the hold, I've been using these mostly as monitors while recording guitar and bass parts, but they've made it through some pretty enthusiastic headbanging without getting dislodged. It also prevents almost all the banging and noise you normally hear when handling your headphones.\\n\\nThe ear pads are soft and comfortable and have a nice synthetic cover which feels like glove leather and has just the right combination of grip and smoothness.\\n\\nThey are semi-open. In this case it means that with no sound coming out of them they are basically aurally transparent but when they are on it takes a pretty loud sound outside to be noticeable. They are excellent at the job I use them for, monitoring a master track while laying down new parts, because you can hear yourself and the room sound pretty naturally and still have a high quality monitor with no bleed through to the mic'ed amps. If you are intending to use these for monitoring during vocal track recording you might want to consider a closed back design, these can be a little loud close up, The K271 is an excellent option with an ingenious auto-mute feature that work off the same magical suspension system.\\n\\nOther Cool Features:\\n\\nmini-xlr connector on cord - replace your mangled cord or make your own!\\nfully rebuildable and modular - any component can be replaced if neccesary\\n\\nGripes:\\n\\nIt ships with a 3m mini-xlr to 1/8 cord w/ 1/4 adapter, I think most people would prefer the coiled cord which they sell as an option.\\n\\nThe suspension may 'feel' a bit insecure at first, and the pads may wiggle a bit if you shake your head really hard. a manual tension adjustment on the suspension might be a nice addition.\\n\\nYou really need a case for your studio headphones. As far as I know there isn't one available for these.\", 'I have been using AKG headphones since the mid 70\\'s when I started seeing them on the heads of every entertainer in the recording studio environment in film and television.  This said volumes to me about the acceptance by the real professionals. Bought my first pair back then and have had them over the years, occassionally upgrading to newest technology model. I happened to be in the discotheque business back then and I bought AKG\\'s for DJ use in all six of our clubs throughout the country. These are fantastic with full range of natural sound from lows to highs. Does not color the sound and they really kick if you loop them through EQ. Ain\\'t nothin\\' better. I am so spoiled that sometimes I prefer listening to concert DVD\\'s with these on rather than listening \"full room\" with my very expensive and well appointed home component audio system. And I occassionally go back to my original set of AKG\\'s purchased in 1976 and they still sound awesome, although the rubber ear pads have become rather hardened and I cant wear them for long. My only complaint about this new pair of \"around the ear\" phones is that you tend to sweat a bit after wearing them through a movie. I also have a set of fairly recent model 141\\'s that are the \"on the ear\" smaller pad model with very soft foam pads and I must say that I probably prefer them to the full ear enclosure, for that reason. Other than that, you can\\'t beat the undisputed champ in headphone sound, and at an amazing price point for the quality of the sound.', 'The AKG K 240S is the replacement for the K240M.  Impedance has been reduced from 600 ohms to 55 ohms.  Bass response has been extended and midrange is flatter in response.  Consider buying the K 240 studio phones in the MK II package and you will have spare cord and spare earpads.', 'I use this microphone for announcing at baseball and football games. Works great! I did purchase an inline on/off switch, though.', \"When we added on-screen hymn lyrics to the Mass at St. Mary's Church, my duties as choir singer and sound engineer suddenly included PowerPoint projectionist. I need a microphone that does its job without getting in the way, but it also has to be where I need it when I turn my attention from the audio mixer to the computer. Since I sit right next to the gear, we didn't need the expense of a wireless system (along with its appetite for batteries), and even a wired condenser headset mic was out of the question, budget-wise. For the money, the Shure WH20XLR is a gift from audio heaven.\\n\\nThe headband wraps around behind the head and slips over the ears. Like a pair of glasses, you can become so accustomed to the headband that you almost forget you're wearing it. The four-foot long thin cable routes out of the way behind the wearer's back and terminates in an XLR connector that clips to a pocket or belt, providing a disconnect point. The WH20XLR comes with a pair of windscreens and an additional cable routing clip.\\n\\nThe sound is what Shure is famous for: warm, with a natural presence that never sounds like the wearer is swallowing the mic. The frequency response is on a par with Shure's handheld mics, and the output has enough headroom that I can use the same pre-amp and fader settings as the rest of the mics.\", 'Another Shure stuff. Perfect.', 'The Mic works great, I suspect the following scenario, which has been around since about 1960. Im 70, very mechanically adept, so I would know.: The engineers come up with a beautiful design, then in walk the bean counters, and the lawyers.\\n\\nThe lawyers say: \"You cant make the cord any longer than 4 feet, because if it lies on the floor, someone could trip on it, and we could be sued\" then the bean counters chime in \"Yeah and just think, we can save 40 cents worth of wire on every one by making the cord only about 4 feet.\" And Woosh, there goes the superb design developed by the engineers at Shure. This has been the procedure that has literally ruined the \"Made IN The USA\"  Label that was placed on every decent thing produced before about 1960. This case affirms the \"What do you call 1000 Lawyers at the bottom of the Ocean?\" \"A good Start\"  Adage to a Tee. The cord is too F*#King short, but its great if you have 0 stage presence and you like to sit on your PA.', 'Shure sound and build quality.  Great mic.', \"This takes me where I wanted to go. I bought this to get the big boom stand and microphone out of my face while playing drums in my band. When we played Tulsa Time at our latest gig, the audience did a double take to see where the singer was. I was hiding behind my big Paiste China cymbal. Very good sound. Not muddy, but crisp. Take note: Instructions say to hold away from the corner of your mouth. I have a beard and had to get the element right on my lips to get the sound and volume I needed , but that may be due to the fact that our PA is ancient and I was running through a secondary mixer with all my drums.\\nVery nice and it's a SHURE.......that says it all. If you are a musician , and need your hands free and don't want to drop a fortune on a wireless system, this is for you. I plugged it into the on/off switch I bought with it and then into a 20' XLR cable to our mixer. NO WIRELESS BELT PACK NEEDED. Good job Shure\", 'The output is pretty low.  I run this mic into a preamp then to the mixer.  This boost the input signal to normal levels and really warms up the sound.  The mic itself is very comfortable with the proper adjustments and sounds crystal clear.  I run sound and play lead guitar at the same time and this mic allows me to do both with ease.  Get a preamp they are not expensive.  I use an ART Tube MP.......it does amazing things for this mic.', \"What a nice mic. It works great for the football and lacrosse games I announce for. I don't know about singing through it though. For that I still use my SM58 for the national anthem.\", 'A good upgrade for much cheaper mics. Nothing fancy, but works well so far for the puppet ministry at my church', 'I have used this product for the past 15 years playing with bands and I can honestly say that this is the mic for me!  I like it so well that when it finally gave out (after 14 years of service), that I purchased another one and it continues to give faithful service to this day.  I have yet to have a feedback problem with it, and being a guitar player, I move around quite a bit and it has never been a problem.  I would highly recommend this for any musician that wants a quality headset mic without breaking the bank!', \"The first time I used this microphone my friends told me that it was the best I had ever sounded.  That's because the mic follows your head no matter which way you turn it, which I seem to do a lot when I sing and play guitar.  It takes a little getting used to not being able to back away from the mic but it didn't take me long to adjust.  I did buy a separate foot switch to mute the mic when needed (for sneezes, clearing your throat, etc.).  The mic fits my head well and sounds great.\", 'Works great!', \"I bought this headset 6 years ago to use with my dj show. The sound is good for the price and it doesn't sound like a cheep headset that computer users may buy. My biggest peeve with this mic is that it fits tight on my head and after a while it starts to hurt behind my ears which is why I gave it 4 stars. But if you're looking for a good mix that won't break the bank and have a smaller head (or don't mind the pressure and/or won't be wearing it for a long time) then this is a good unit. I would like to hear the condenser version they have now but it's about $50 more.

The sound quality is very good as far as headset mic's go.  The unit is stable on my head and the mic stays where I put it....about an inch in front of the right side of my mouth.  Right where it should  be.  It only took me a few minutes to adjust the harness part to fit fairly comfortably on my head.  After a while I didn't really even notice it.  Everybody's head is different, so some people might have a harder time than others finding the perfect position for it.

Neither mic is particularly hot and both do best when run through a mic pre amp, but for the small rooms we play this is not necessary.\\n\\nOne of the best points about this is it is comfortable and the mic itself can be adjusted closer or farther for better control over vocal quality. Also it is less apt to feedback. To me this is important in the small rooms we play because some handheld mics that we use are problematic in that aspect.\\n\\nOverall, this is an excellent wired headset that does a competent job with vocals in small venues. If you use SM58s you have a good idea about the sound characteristics, so that is not going to require much of an adjustment. Plus this mic is built to withstand a heavy gigging schedule (we use the original box to store it.) The latter is one of the main reasons why I awarded this headset five stars.', 'Really good sound, great for moving around while performing.', 'It fit okay and was comfortable but, although it might be fine for a speaker, the tone was not adequate for singing.

In all honesty, these are the best sounding passive speakers I've ever heard. Do yourself a favor and give them a try. The secret is in the woofer material and porting I think.\", 'The Alesis Monitor One Mk2 monitors surprised me with really good sound quality and stereo imaging. Listening to these makes it evident that the engineers who worked on this product really made an effort to sweat the small details that make for truly good sound. The crossover network (the electronic circuit that transfers high frequencies to the tweeter and low frequencies to the woofer) is one of the most critical components in a good loudspeaker system, and it\\'s not easy to get it right in a passive loudspeaker system - but the Alesis engineers managed to do it. The result is smooth imaging and sound dispersion through the midrange and into the high frequencies, which makes the sound seem \"larger than the box\" - you never hear a little wooden box, instead you hear a glorious expanse of sound filling the entire sound stage.\\n\\nI\\'d recommend these Alesis monitors not only to home recording engineers, but also for general music and TV listening. If you\\'re used to muffled consumer-grade speakers, these monitors will sound a little bright at first - and then you\\'ll notice how much more detail you\\'re hearing in the music, detail that is obscured by lower quality speakers.\\n\\nThe Monitor One\\'s have good bass response for their size, but this is inevitably limited by the 5\" effective piston diameter of the woofers. I added a budget Velodyne VX-11 subwoofer to extend the bass response of the Monitor One\\'s. The subwoofer is set to roughly a 70 Hz crossover frequency, and about 8 o\\'clock on the sub volume knob. The Velodyne integrates very smoothly with the Monitor One\\'s at these settings, and the overall sound is nothing short of superb - for a total budget of about $300 for both monitors and subwoofer! Outstanding sound on the cheap!\\n\\nI have not heard anything that sounds audibly better than these Alesis Monitor One\\'s until you get to the Mackie HR 824\\'s in the $1300 range - more than *seven times* the Amazon price of the Alesis Monitor One\\'s!\\n\\nAs an aside, these passive Alesis Monitor One\\'s sound much better than the active Alesis M1 Active Mk II monitors do. The active monitors use the same woofer and tweeter, and the active crossover network is even smoother, but unfortunately the M1 Active\\'s have very sloppy, boomy, undefined one-note bass that ruins the otherwise smooth balance of their sound. A real pity.\\n\\nIn summary, if you\\'re looking to spend under $1300 for a pair of monitors, check these Alesis Monitor One Mk 2 out. There\\'s a lot to love about them, and not much to critique.', 'I bought my first pair of Monitor One speakers from Alesis when they first came out over twelve years ago. I used them for front speakers in a home theater sound system, for recording studio monitors, as stereo speakers in my home audio system, and I\\'ve used them as PA speakers for practice drum sessions. Except for a tweeter that blew about eight years ago (and Alesis was GREAT! providing a replacement tweeter) these speakers are still going strong. You will not find a more robust, better sounding pair of studio monitors for the money, especially at the sale prices being offered now (3/4/10). In fact, I just ordered my second pair of Monitor Ones on Tuesday. I\\'ve been overdue for a pair of the MK IIs, which are magnetically shielded. The original Monitor Ones are not magnetically shielded, something to keep that in mind if you\\'re looking to buy used. You\\'ll want a magnetically shielded pair if you plan on housing the monitors near a TV or computer.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of the Monitor Ones reproduction detail: I had my brother visiting one day. I sat him down about four feet away from the speakers and put on a Joe Satriani CD. We got to this one song and all of a sudden my brother looked up and said: \"Wow, that\\'s the first time I ever heard that.\" He was talking about a little pic work that you won\\'t hear on anything but a good set of near-field studio monitors.\\n\\nI\\'m know there are other excellent near-field monitors out there, and there\\'s almost no limit on what you can spend. M-Audio are highly rated, and the new top shelf Tannoys and JBLs are $1,000 and $1,500, respectively.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a professional recording engineer or musician, that\\'s one thing. You can probably justify spending a lot more. But if you\\'re in the semi-pro category or just an audiophile who wants the hear the music as it was intended to be heard, I don\\'t think you\\'ll be disappointed with these monitors.\\n\\n-seabgb', 'I read all of the glowing reviews of this product and considering the low price point these monitors seemed like a \"no-brainer\" purchase. The speakers were going to be suspended on the wall of my tracking room and used as playback monitors for musicians to spot check their recordings. They weight a little more than 15 pounds each, so they are not light like most traditional bookshelf speakers. The cabinet is dense (laminated) particle board with a nice fit and finish. Good looking, but nothing fancy either. Since they were not going to be used as critical monitors in the control room or for mix & mastering cost was a serious factor for most project studio owners, isn\\'t it?  The Alesis Monitor1 MKii\\'s are a good, practical solution.\\nUnfortunately, the first pair I ordered from Amazon arrived with one of the monitors suffering from a blown or defective woofer -producing an annoying buzz across most low-midrange frequencies.  I returned them using Amazons pre-arranged return/pick up policies which was pretty hassle free (save those packing materials if you have the room or at least, until you\\'re confident your purchases work properly) .\\nThe replacement monitors worked as anticipated... these are excellent passive (yes, you need to power them with a separate amplifier) monitors - with very accurate sound reproduction for the low price and represent a great value.', \"I just received these today after a very speedy delivery.

I've been using AV40s since 2010 and they died on me.  These feel like they will last a lifetime and I hope they do.  Right now I am driving them with an old Sony STR D615 100w receiver and they sound and respond great.  I will probably purchase another studio quality amp at a later date but for now there is no need.  I can hear my mixes more clearly for the first time and already have made some adjustments to them because of the Monitor Ones!  I was unaware of bad mixes using my old monitors.  These also sound good with all other music devices (cd, radio etc).\\n\\nI've read some reviews that said the bass is lacking...that is far from the truth...the bass is tight and strong...so much that I found that I have been over compensating with my old monitors.  The highs and the mids are good as well.  I wish I purchased these a long time ago...I would have saved some money! I think these will hold up...they are definately built like a tank and will last a long time if they are not abused...which I have no plan on doing.

I have them sitting in extreme near field, 3 feet apart and 3 feet from my ears and the detail and imaging are superb even at low volume. At louder levels they will punch you with bass and percussive transients for hours without being fatiguing.\\n\\nBe aware that for bass heavy audio you will need a sub-woofer for accurate mixes, but regardless, these do an outstanding job in the low end upwards of 60 hz, and probably lower depending on the material. (They are spec'd to 45 Hz.)\\n\\nRated at 4 ohms, in my setup they are powered by a Luxman 50 watt per channel receiver, a clean amp which while not that powerful, drives them just fine at low to middling high volume.\\n\\nHighly recommended!

You will not be disappointed with these fine reference monitors.\", 'excellent!!', \"Great mic. Use it every night on tour. Good for loud bands with softer vocals.

I switched to a 58 windscreen and it is a perfect vocal solution.  Clear, bright but without any harshness.  I have a 58  where we rehearse (the Beta only comes out at gigs) and I can hear the difference.

I record at home, running microphones through a mixer and then into an audio interface, into the computer.  The SM57 is considered a staple for recording guitar amps, as well it should be... except this mic is TRUE to sound.  Without a bass cut, and a *mostly* flat EQ (I trimmed the highs by about -4dB), I can't tell the difference between the sound of my amp and the sound coming through the headphones.  I was very skeptical because a lot of reviews make it sound like this is better all-around microphone than the SM57, but less of a specifically-recording-electric-guitar microphone, and I cannot disagree more.  This is my new go-to microphone for recording electric guitar.\", \"I bought this mic for it's reputation as a workhorse both in the studio and in a live gig setting. So far I've put it through some use in both contexts and it's performed wonderfully.\\n\\nIn a live application, I've used it as a vocal mic- there seems to be some debate over whether this or the Beta 58 is a better choice for live vocals, and I'd say that having heard both used onstage, I like the 57A because it cuts through the muddiness of most small venues a lot better. If you're playing a killer sounding room like, I don't know... the Ryman, it likely won't matter, but in the brewery barroom that resembled a really crowded hallway that we played the other night it made all the difference in the world over even an SM58- it was nice to hear myself sounding more like myself in the monitor. I've also noticed a few musicians that I respect a lot using it, and even Obama had one in his hand the other night while giving a speech.\\n\\nIn my home studio, I've used the 57A to mic a snare (sounds killer, tons of snap and body), acoustic guitar (not bad at all, although I prefer an SDC mic here), and a guitar cabinet (sounds great.)\\n\\nOverall, I don't think you can go wrong with this mic. I'd like to add a Beta 58 to the collection as well, but after a lot of research I think the 57A is the most versatile of the two so if you're on a limited budget as most musicians are, I'd go with this. You won't be disappointed, and I'd be surprised if I find a dynamic mic that replaces it in my every-day, go-to gear case anytime soon.\", \"Hey, whatta ya want?  It's a 57!!!

It didn't have a wider spectrum, and it just sounds different, not bad and not amazing. It truly depends on your personal taste. I was using it on an EVH 5153 amp and cab.\", \"Terrific back-up mic. I use wireless mic's and this mic is my go-to back up if any of the wireless fail.\", 'Test record on this mic, it sounds good both on vocal and on acoustic guitar.', \"I have owned many condenser mics. The Shure Beta 57A is my first and only dynamic. I wanted a jack of all trades dynamic that was great in quality, great in sound and affordably priced. This is what I picked.\\n\\nVocal mics tend to have a general sound quality in common. They flatten the hills and valleys of your voice and brighten it up. Listen to network news broadcasts and you'll hear what I mean. Speech intelligibility and voice power improves because you voice becomes like a wall of sound that is stronger and brighter. Many cardioid condenser mics also do this, and part of the reason has to do with the cardioid construction resulting in diminished bass and an accented upper midrange.\\n\\nThe quality is very fine overall. Solid, thick-walled, metal construction. Paint is applied very evenly. The grill wires look thick and robust. Fit and finish are as good as you'll ever get.\\n\\nAs for sound, it's like I mentioned. Bright and powerful. I did A/B tests with some condenser mics at the same distance from my lips, and it's obvious what voice mics do, and this one does it well. Note that it is billed as an instrument mic, but the only difference between the Beta 58A and 57A is the grill, if I understand correctly, which can result in a slight difference in sound quality.\\n\\nThe XLR male connector seems good (I've had mics where the XLR hole is too small for the XLR cable connector to fit in), not too big and not too small, so the drilling of the hole in the mic for the XLR connector is at the correct tolerance.\\n\\nPlosives are under control with this mic, as the multi-layered grill assembly does a good job keeping the air out.\\n\\nOK, now you're probably wondering what's not so good about this mic. Well, the one thing I don't like is that the grill is not aligned symmetrically with the Shure nameplate, either on a flat side or at a diagonal). Soes the grill screw on, or is it permanently mounted, or is it a clip-on? If it's a screw-on, then I can see how it's not aligned perfectly, you have to turn it to line it up.\\n\\nI wish the body was black, because it's less obtrusive in appearance.\\n\\nThe output is not high, I have to turn up the gain on my Focusrite 2i4 all the way to get the required gain, when speaking about 6 inches from the mic. But the specs say it's several db more sensitive than the SM57.\\n\\nThe sound is less smooth than an SM57, from what I can tell. This mic works best for male singers with a dull, dark timbre, as it will brighten and strengthen things up. It will certainly brighten and strengthen instruments, but it will sound different than the SM57 sound that everyone is used to\", 'Good mic, nice to have a variation of the classic SM 57.', \"I used the Shure SM-58 for over 40 years so it was hard to let go.

Live wise its perfect because the frequency range that it picks up is great for getting the vocals above the music without feedback!!!', 'Everybody knows who set \"the standard\" when it comes to an acceptable level of audio quality with microphones.  This is a great supercard, dynamic mic.  My primary use for it is miking acoustic guitars.  Turns out it can do pretty good vocals as well.  The biggest difference between the Beta 57, and the regular 57 is the Beta is a supercard while the standard 57 is just a cardioid.  So the Beta is also a bit hotter, and a little less muddy, if you will, while still maintaining a good level of warmth & fullness.  You can spend a bunch of money on instrument mics if you choose.  But the Beta 57 will cover a lot of bases, and do it well.  I would probably opt for the standard 57 for miking electric guitar amps.', 'I use this for my loud big voice vocals.

I have used other mics like the SM 57 or the Sennheiser MD421Mk2, but the Beta 57a blows them out of the water.  It works great for saxes and clarinets since they both need a more broad pick up of sound.  I would highly recommend this mic to anyone who likes the SM57 sound, but is tired of the low sensitivity.

Initially I did he snobby thing and said \"wow look at how boosted the lows and highs are on that mic, I\\'d rather a natural sounding kick mic\" I\\'m over the elitist mentality. This mic just sounds right across several genres. For rock, it can capture that kick \"click\" sound in the high end to cut through a dense mix. Yet for folk or softer music you can do a low pass to it and it instantly becomes warm and mellow. I tried it on an upright bass blended w a CAD m179. Perfect. Cad got the air and presence and this mic got the lows. Lasty, the price is right and I would buy it if I no longer had access to this loaner.

I paid top dollars for other brands and even for Shure's other models, but this one is a perfect fit for my system. The bass is natural, not boom-y and mids and highs are clear and clean. The weight is heavy enough to not allow the needle to jump out of the groove and skip or light enough where it looses it's tracking.\", 'Shure does what it is supposed to', 'Sounds great.  Tracks great.  This is the \"hifi\" version of the stylus for the very heavy tracking SC35C cartridge.  Tracks very well at 2.0-2.5 grams.  The sound is a little on the bright side.  This would likely be welcome for many folks.\\n\\nPut this N35X stylus into the body of an SC35C, and you have a much better tracking, and better sounding cartridge...unless you NEED to track it at 4-5 grams...then the SC35C is what you need.  I had a lot of old SC35C cartridge bodies laying around at my place, but didn\\'t like the sound, or the very heavy tracking.  These great sounding, great tracking styli make those usable to me now.

It\\'s nice to have a disposable \"nail\" that I can use in that great cartridge for tracking flea market vinyl finds!

These needles are the soldiers who will fight with me to the top. It's not common for a good long lasting great sounding product to come around but when it does you need to buy it and keep it. If I ever recover my stolen items I will never lose them again. Thanks amazon for asking my opinion once again and thanks Shure for sponsoring me and sending these to me. You guys are the $&@t!!!\", \"I purchased this cartridge for my Technics SL-1200 so I could use it for DJing when needed. As I use my 1200 for both DJing and normal listening, I switch the M44G and my slipmat out for my Shure M97xE and standard Technics rubber mat as needed. So far, it has proven itself and has exceeded my expectations. I am rather new to DJing with real vinyl which should be taking into account. But, while I was practicing, it never lost track while both cueing and when doing spin-backs and other things. I am not a scratch DJ, however, so I didn't try any of that type of stuff and the M44-7 seems to be Shure's recommended choice for scratching.\\n\\nCompared to my M97xE cartridge it is louder in both raw output and in the music being heard off the turntable directly. The latter bit is a clue that the M44G is probably a bit harder on vinyl than the M97xE. It is, a DJ cartridge, after all. Of note, it has a lower recommended tracking force than the DJ cartridges from other brands that I was looking at and Shure mentions it offers ultra low record wear. Still, I will continue to use my M97xE when I'm not DJing.\\n\\nThe overall sound of the M44G is just fantastic! The highs are pronounced and clear and the bass defined and boomey. I thought it unfair to directly compare it to the sound of my M97xE as it has seen more use and the needle is no longer new. Plus, I use it the M97xE with the brush down which can impact audio quality a bit. Really, a direct comparison is a bit silly anyway as the M44G is for DJing first. If you just want to listen to records, I would consider something else.\\n\\nAs a DJ cartridge, though, it really shines and certainly has my vote!\", 'everything is ok', 'I purchased this cartridge for my Technics turntable. I listen to a lot of music from the \\'50s, \\'60s, and \\'70s. I was looking for a cartridge that would faithfully reproduce the warm analog sound from that era, and I also wanted something that would be very gentle to my records. I did a lot of research, and the M44G seemed to meet most of my requirements, so I purchased one and installed it on my Technics.\\n\\nI\\'ve been using it for about three months and I\\'m quite happy with it thus far. It\\'s not the best-sounding cartridge I\\'ve ever heard, but I wasn\\'t expecting it to be. It performs well on my old \\'50s/\\'60s records. It tracks very securely at 1.5 grams. I tried running it at lower tracking weights but it skipped much more frequently at those weights. 1.5g definitely seems to be the sweet spot, and is still light enough that I\\'m not worried about it causing undue wear and tear on my records.\\n\\n(If you\\'re unsure about the accuracy of your turntable\\'s counterweight and/or if you find it difficult to accurately balance your tonearm, do yourself a huge favor and get a stylus force gauge! It\\'s a big timesaver and ensures accuracy.  I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Signstek-Digital-Stylus-Force-Gauge/dp/B00E7MVP3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Signstek Digital Stylus Force Gauge</a>.)\\n\\nThere is some inner groove distortion, but that is to be expected when using a cartridge with a conical stylus. You may be able to mitigate this to some extent if you use an alignment protractor. I aligned mine using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Technics-overhang-gauge/dp/B001EY982C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Technics overhang gauge</a>.\\n\\nDon\\'t be deterred by the fact that Shure markets this cartridge to DJs. The M44 series were originally intended as audiophile cartridges, and it was only in recent times that they developed a following in the DJ community. The M44G in particular is a VERY gentle cartridge and it will not harm your records the way some other DJ cartridges will. If you\\'re a home audio listener and you\\'re trying to decide between the M44G and the M44-7, I recommend the M44G. Not only does it track at a gentler weight, it also has an output that is more likely to work well with home audio gear. The M44-7 has an extremely high output and it might overload your receiver or pre-amp, causing distortion and clipping.\\n\\nAs far as audio quality is concerned, I would describe the M44G as warm, punchy, and a little bit retro (for lack of a better word). It seems to work well with rock/pop/jazz/R&B from the \\'50s/\\'60s/\\'70s. I imagine it would work well with country music too. If you\\'re looking for a \"bright\" cartridge with emphasized treble, it\\'s probably not your best choice. My speakers are quite bright to begin with, so the M44G still provides me with very clear treble.\\n\\nIf you buy it, make sure you align it properly. Even though conical stylii are supposed to be more forgiving of improper alignment, aligning it correctly does make a big difference. The alignment instructions that come with the cartridge only apply to DJ use and should not be followed for audiophile use. Instead, use an alignment gauge that\\'s compatible with your turntable, or use an alignment protractor.', 'Absolutely perfect for what I needed for my stereo set-up at school as a music teacher.', \"If you're looking for a quality, compact stereo mixer to combine multiple audio sources and output to a single pair of headphones or speakers, this device works perfectly. Measuring roughly 5 inches by 3 inches, its construction is solid and surprisingly made in the USA. All of the ports feature a nice and tight fit and the knobs are silky smooth. It's powered by a power adapter which is included.\\n\\nIt has four separate channel inputs and two output options. Channel 1 is an XLR input with phantom power option (which you can turn on/off). Channel 2 input is via RCA or 3.5mm. Channels 3 and 4's input are RCA. Output is via RCA or 3.5mm. There are more than enough ways you can set this up depending on your devices and needs. If you need to use 3.5mm, either as an input or output, you can simply buy a 3.5mm to RCA cable adapter.\\n\\nSome reviews complain about static, hissing, or lowered volume; I have not encountered any of these issues under normal use. As long as you are using quality cables and your source output devices aren't cheap, no audio issues should be encountered. I can easily control each channel's volume independently with no loss in audio quality. Turning the knob all the way down will completely mute the source and turning it up has more than ample volume (although this may vary a bit depending on the quality of your output device). The only actual hissing I can hear (using headphones) is when you get near max volume on the knob when all other channels are silent. At the volumes you encounter the hissing at, you would blow your eardrums out. Under normal use, you don't hear it at all.\\n\\nThere are obviously several ways you can hook this up. For reference, I am using it to connect the audio from my PC and the audio from my game consoles (PS4 and Switch) and have it all output to my headphones. In my case, the game consoles are hooked up to a Denon A/V receiver and I am using the headphone output from it to connect to the stereo mixer. For the PC audio, I am simply using the front 3.5mm output and have it connected to the stereo mixer. From the stereo mixer, I have the output audio plug into an external headphone amplifier which then finally outputs it to my headphones. My headphone amplifier definitely helps with overall volume, but even without it, the stereo mixer has plenty of power to output enough volume even to my higher ohm headphones from Sennheiser and AKG. Even hitting about halfway on the knob gets too loud and about a quarter of the way is good enough for normal use.\\n\\nWith this particular setup, I can now get game sounds and if needed, I can stream music from my PC at the same time. Or I can use voice chat on the PC instead of using Playstation's party chat or the Nintendo Switch's currently horrible (non-existent) chat system. And of course if I just want one audio source, then I can simply turn down the knob on the stereo mixer to mute it completely.\\n\\nAll in all, this is an excellent compact stereo mixer which makes life easier if you have a setup requiring multiple audio sources outputting to a single headphone/speaker setup at the same time. It works well as somewhat of an audio switcher as well without actually having to switch inputs or cables around. If this sounds like what you need, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product.\", \"I bought this to combine PS3 audio with the DAC from my computer so I could play the PS3 at my computer desk and be able to use two headphones (on separate amps) for both sources.

(Don't try this at home unless you're standing right there in front ready to stop the pendulum!) In other words, the design of the stand allows the guitar to hang too close to vertical, and if the guitar is extra heavy, it can be tipped forward with a relatively light-to-moderate bump from behind.

There wasn't a moment when i felt like i broke it, i just tried to use it one day and it failed. The lock on the legs has failed and it will no longer do it's job to hold my guitar up.

This stand has the same design as the hercules stands but is not quite as solid but then again, it is cheaper. I bought the stand for use a church and it has worked well. The \"hanging\" style of this and the hercules stands are the only way to go if you want your guitar to be safe. Do not make the mistake of trying toi save money by buying the tubular desing wherein the guitar simply sits on the stand. Even if this type of stand is solidly built the design is flawed. With those types of stands a simple bump by someone walking past the instrument or a brink wind when outside will knock over the stand and your precious instrument. I would rather lean my guitars on an amp or chair than use one of those type of stands. They are for fools only. If you can afford it, get the Hercules. It is the best stand on the market.

I did one modification (being paranoid), once it was extended and set up, I wrapped black duct tape around the tightened extension grip.  Why?  Because if the extension fails, everything could suddenly drop.  So if you extend it up and intend to leave it in one place, I suggest duct taping the extension lever in its tightened position.\\n\\nThere are no bad effects of this stand on my guitars.

Note: This is the one you will want if you have a Stratocaster, because of the location of the output jack on the guitar.

I don't gig with my stand, it simply sits in my practice space and holds my guitar. After owning the stand for about a year out of nowhere one of the front legs gave out and my G&L hit the floor. After inspection the plastic locking mechanism simply broke just from the constant weight of the guitar hanging on it. I contacted Ultimate and they sent me out a replacement locking mechanism and I drilled out the rivet and replaced. Worked fine for 4 months and the exact same thing happened but this time I was simply hanging the guitar and the leg gave out so my Legacy didn't hit the floor. Called Ultimate again and they are now sending me a complete new stand. Still not satisfied with the safety of my guitar on this stand old or new I again took apart the old stand and cut a piece of metal pipe ( top rail pipe of chain link fence fit perfect ) that fits super tight in the bottom hole for the locking mechanism and simply made it to where the stand will no longer collapse for transport.

If it's going to be a hassle (with extra parts that go missing and/or tedious setup) or if it's inclined to dump my instrument onto the floor, I'd honestly rather just lean my bass against the amp or stow it in the gig bag on breaks.\\n\\nThis is the only stand I actually enjoy using. Simple, quick, solid, reliable, holds up after years of abuse. For me this is The One. The recent purchase is to replace my old one which I stupidly left behind in a parking lot one night.\\n\\nI avoided the fancier model with arms that swivel down when you rest the headstock in the cradle. That's the kind of thing that gets in the way and breaks after just a few months of bouncing around with all the other stands in the truck.

It got a bit tricky because the rod does not easily line up with the holes on the case and holes on my devices, so it took some doing.

I missed Amazon\\'s return window by 2 days, so I would apparently eat the shipping. I\\'ve emailed Ultimate Support. If they replace it under warranty, I\\'ll probably just give it away, as I can\\'t stand using it regardless of the defective height cam. I\\'ve ordered a third K&M Memphis Pro instead. Further update: Amazon came through promptly authorizing a return after emailing them as well. Ultimate Support customer support also responded very quickly with a suggestion to check that the lever pin was seated evenly (it was), and if not to send them a picture and a copy of my receipt- they would take care of it. It was very reassuring to hear from them so quickly; I emailed K&M about a defective stand a few months back and never heard back from them.\\n\\nOut of the box, I really like the simple design, easy opening and adjustment, and how compact it folds up. In use, though I find this much more flimsy than two others that I currently have. Every joint has more flex than I\\'d like. The other two I own have automatic gripping or \"locking\" mechanisms, which I believe are not necessary, given the angle at which the instrument rests (the force required to dislodge any of my instruments from the stand would certainly tip the whole stand over). This one just has an optional rubber strap which cleverly has a tab to hold it out of the way when not in use. I like the design, but for my basses the shape of the yoke doesn\\'t work so well- it holds them fine, the problem is removing them the neck is sort of wedged onto the vee shape of the yoke, so lifting the bass lifts the yoke up too and you kind of have to jerk it free. The height locking cam, while a super simple and clever design doesn\\'t hold very securely. But the joint flexes so much when extended fully to accommodate my 5 string Jazz basses that when I set the bass down, the weight isn\\'t pushing directly down on the lower portion, so it doesn\\'t appear to slip. But the stand is brand new, and I imagine the cam will only get weaker, as it is plastic, and it latches against the metal tube. I\\'m not sure this is by design or if mine is outside manufacturing tolerances. This and the flimsiness may cause this one to be sent back. I should note, it doesn\\'t appear the flex in all the joints weakens its stability much. In fact it could potentially make it more resistant to tipping. But to me it suggests either poor quality control, poor materials, poor design or corners cut. Edit: given my defective height adjustment cam, much of the flex I noticed could have been a result of that particular defect in mine. Overall, the materials and construction seem well thought out.\\n\\nI\\'ve been on a hanging stand buying spree of sorts lately.

I loved the first K&M, but the second had critical defects out of the box. The Hercules is very good, but is much bulkier than the K&M and Ultimate when folded (not including the non-folding yoke on the Hercules, I\\'m aware they sell one with that- in this case it is the girth and length of which I speak).\\n\\nIf it weren\\'t for the flimsiness of this compared to the others (Edit: which could be simply due to a faulty height adjustment latch lever), I\\'d say it is very competitive with the other two- especially considering the price. The K&M is the lightest, most compact when folded, and the most enjoyable to use - however it is somewhat fragile (be careful not to open it too forcefully, or the height stop in the top tube will snap off). This one, the Ultimate GS100 is the second lightest, and almost as small folded as the K&M. I\\'d really like the way the legs fold on the Ultimate, if the joints didn\\'t flex so much in use. The hanging yoke of the K&M is also my favorite, as the arms rotate inwards with weight applied, basically automatically adjusting for your neck width. For some necks, the Ultimate GS100 yoke may work better than it does for mine. Again, I think a simple yoke is all that is needed for most instruments on this type of stand. The number of moving pieces on the K&M appears much fewer than the Hercules yoke, and the arms of the K&M seem more durable too. The Hercules stand\\'s frame seems the most stout with the least flex, and for mostly stationary use, it might be my favorite of these three. For packing in and out at rehearsal or the gig, the K&M is the winner for me, as it fits the front pocket of my bass gig bags (well 3/4 of the way at least).\\n\\nBottom line on this one? Others have had great success with it, but having tried the other two, I can\\'t say I\\'d recommend it over them. But if saving $10 or so is important, and you don\\'t mind a little flex, or plan to use it with lighter instruments (my heaviest is just shy of 11lbs), this might not be that bad of a choice. It does fold up very nicely- and folds, unfolds very easily.', 'This is first rack case I have had to buy having gone from my big AMPEG SVT tube head to smaller (or lighter) amp SVT-3PRO.  I added a rack mount tuner and power controller and feel that my investments are now road safe in the this rack.  Not knowing much about them I went for the name and after reading reviews I am convinced I bought the best rack case I could, regardless of expense.  I mean come on when you have $1500 worth of gear you want to be able to transport safely and set up easily money should not be an issue.  That being said, This was reasonably priced and well worth the money.  I think the lock and key is somewhat a waste because someone would probably steal the whole thing and care less about the lock.  It is light and has comfortable sturdy carrying handles', 'Good product, just as described', 'Solid Cases. A little bigger then I thought..', 'I decided to give the GS-55 a try after being happy with lots of different Ultimate stands over the years and because of its compact size. I appreciate any reduction in weight when carrying gear to gigs.\\n\\nThe stand seems well built and sturdy enough as one would expect from Ultimate. I wouldn\\'t worry about a guitar sliding off of it unless it was really bumped into. However, if you\\'ve got either a strap on your guitar or a cable plugged into it, one of these two will inevitably get caught up in the support arms and knock the whole stand over when you pick the instrument back up. I tried this over and over with acoustic and electric and the thing fell over because of this more often than not. The support arms are covered in grippy rubber and they do not \"clip\" into place. Therefore they sort of wander and are just begging to get caught on something. This doesn\\'t cut it in a performance setting where you need to be able to pick up and set down your guitars quickly.\\n\\nIf you just need something with an understated look for home use (where you\\'re not using a strap or plugging in), this might be a great pick. I\\'m just surprised that anyone would find it adequate for gigs. Mine\\'s going back in exchange for another GS-100 which I\\'ve previously had and would definitely recommend for live use.', 'I ordered this rack to replace an SKB roto-molded 8-space unit with wheels and a handle I recently ordered and promptly returned.  While that was a nice unit, it was simply too large and too heavy to carry around a couple times a week.  I would have gone SKB because I\\'ve had great experiences with them in the past.  However, after getting that last SKB rack, I wanted to get the smallest and lightest rack I could find to mount my guitar equipment.\\n\\nFirst off, this is a shallow rack (14.5\" from the front rail to the rear panel), but not as shallow as the shallow SKB units (11\").  This is great, as I have a Furman PL-Plus C, which would not have been an option for their shallow-mount cases.  Point: Gator.\\n\\nThe overall construction of the case is as expected.  It\\'ll be durable enough to carry around your equipment, but something probably wouldn\\'t survive a 6 foot fall.  Other reviewers commented having plastic shavings inside the rack?  Not the case here.  It also comes with a bag of screws with rubber washers (nice), which I didn\\'t really need as I already have a ton of these, but a nice touch nonetheless.\\n\\nCarrying it is a breeze.  Because it\\'s lightweight and shallow, carrying a full rack (unless you have heavy tube pre/power amps) is completely manageable.  The handles feel nice and durable, but I\\'m only hauling about 30 lbs. of equipment.\\n\\nSo here\\'s the bad stuff:\\n\\nThe rack\\'s aluminum borders on the outside of the rack runs to the inside of the case, and is punched with holes for the rack (it\\'s a single piece of metal).  However, the actual rail is a secondary piece that requires screws to be in place to keep it in that sits behind this piece.  It\\'s not a huge deal, but if you aren\\'t paying attention, all your rack equipment will be mounted sideways.  I almost returned it when I realized everything was sideways, as I thought this was a huge quality control issue, until I realized it could be fixed by loosening the screws, pushing the equipment in the desired direction, and rescrewing while holding it in place.  It\\'s a bit irritating, but that should only ever happen once with this case.\\n\\nAlso, while this unit boasts front and rear rails (which it has), I found that one of the four rails was very poorly drilled.  I actually cannot put screws in about 75% of the positions on one of the rear rails because there is no threading.  Thankfully, the only thing I have to mount on the back was a 1U patchbay, and after rotating the bad rail, I was able to install it successfully.  You might also notice the rails look like a drunk 17 year old drilled the holes.  Once equipment is in place, it\\'s fine, but its a little off-putting at first.  You could always upgrade the rails if you so desire, but if you can get everything mounted, it doesn\\'t really matter.\\n\\nSo because of the issues with the rails, this only gets 4 stars.  I\\'m happy with my purchase, but I\\'m not happy with the quality control of this unit.  Thankfully, for how I will be using this, it doesn\\'t affect me, but your mileage may vary.', 'just what I wanted', 'was too large, returned for 4U', 'nice', \"In terms of actually using this rack, it fits my DJ equipment and keeps it safe from rain. I only have two complaints.\\n\\nThe first is that the side handles are not great once the weight of everything inside exceeds 50 pounds. They're only semi-circles and they really dig into your hands, even though I always carry this with someone else on the other side.\\n\\nThe second complaint is kind of a catch-22....I think there should be a model that does NOT feature the lock and key. It's a nice touch and idea, but in the case of this rack, when you're putting the covers on or off for transport, you have to tilt it away from you to get the bottom tabs of the covers in or out of their slots. Takes a little more time, effort, and care than you'd want\\n\\nIf you need the locking capability, this is a good idea. But keep that in mind if you're really going to load this--for me, this is loaded with around 60 pounds of equipment, and only about 15 of that is on one side, so one side is somewhat difficult to take the cover off.\\n\\nNo problems with dents or actually mounting the equipment, though--this is rock-solid overall.\\n\\nIf you aren't going to be loading this with lots of heavy equipment, I definitely recommend it. Otherwise? It's still a good rack, just consider the aforementioned flaws first.\", \"As far as the rack goes, this is fine. Just be sure you're okay with one this size.\\n\\nI was just starting out as a DJ when I got this, and it served me well until I had to upgrade to a 12U standard rack. Where I am, I couldn't find a place to sell this (not even Craigslist), so I ended up donating it to a school's rummage sale....not my happiest moment.\\n\\nAgain, if you think this all you need, get it; the rack itself is a great product. Just think ahead if you're a DJ. Me, I have two 1U mixers, a 1U power strip, a 2U lighting controller, a 1U rack, a 1U decibel meter, and some other stuff. I only expected I'd have about four or five of those things when I started and had this rack, so now I regret buying it.\\n\\nLike I said, though, NO problems with the rack itself.\\n\\nOne little note--the metal strips where the screws are is actually separate from the rack itself, so you need to keep a few screws in even when no equipment is in there.

The clasps are now on the rack, not the lids. This is reverse of my 4 space gator rack and often leads to some fumbling around since I'm used to holding the clasps as I remove the lid. Same with putting the lids on - it makes much more sense to hold the lid by the clasps and put it on the rack\\n\\n2) The new handle sucks. Big time. It's not the nice bar of extruded aluminium, it's a cheesy nylon strap now with a thin strip of metal at each end where it slides in/out of the case. I keep a really heavy Fryette 2/90/2 tube guitar power amp in this rack and I'm not confident this handle is up to the task for the long haul.\", \"I have had this rack out on 3 rehearsals & 1 gig so far & found it perfect for my needs. It's fairly light weight and that was my biggest concern since having a heavy wood case previously. The replaceable rack mounts may seem funky at first... but I was able to adjust them to fit all installed equipment just fine- just use the screws that hold the rack blade. I also like that there is a rubber seal in the groove where the end caps seal up... hopefully keeps contents dry & dust free.\\nOverall... I'm glad I opted for this unit. I have a Furman Power Conditioner, Carvin Bass Amp installed with a 1 unit/vented space blank at the bottom for airflow and it gives a more finished look to the open rack.\", 'Perfect size.  A little plasticy (that\\'s the 5th star) and I\\'m not sure how rugged this would be on the road.  But in a way the more you put into it the more stable it gets.  Good rails--standard 19\" rack.  Some screws included..enough to get you started.  And the rails are at the front  AND the back.  Buttons up nicely and has handles on both sides.  I wouldn\\'t drop or throw it--but it\\'s a space saver!', \"Fast shipping, great price and product. I've used these stands for ever and never lost a guitar off one.  Keep the center of gravity low and they are as sturdy as a rock.\", \"The stand is stable and seems well made and sturdy. V-shaped grip accommodates finger boards of various widths. I am using the stand for a large bass viola da gamba, and I'm so pleased with it that I have ordered another for my tenor gamba.\", 'I bought this stand after bringing home after giving up on a traditional sub-10 dollar stand for my Flying V. Everytime I set the guitar on that stand, the strap would get tangled up or it bacame a balancing act. After \"solving the problem with duct tape\" on the bottom portion of that stand and then immediatly noticing how crappy that looked for my $1K instrument, I searched for another stand. The GS100 had plenty of good reviews and was on sale w/ free shipping so I took a chance on it. Turns out it is exactly what I was looking for--the \\'legs\\' do not interfere with the guitar strap (which is good because mine is permanently attached from using the \\'washer\\' strap-lock method) and since the guitar just hangs there from the neck support, there is no balancing act required. I also like that it seems to \\'display\\' your axe rather than just support it. And and others have mentioned, it folds up rather nicely if you need to take it with you.', 'These are great cases. I have two of this particular configuration that work well for smaller power amps, audio interface and power strips. Easy access from both sides, sturdy built in hands and excellent clasps. Pro grade.', \"a good plastic rack, can't hardly break them (I've had many over the years). and a generic sized latch if you happen to break them.\", \"This is a great rack case.  It's a little longer then I need as a mobile DJ but it holds everything I need and the wires can even stay in the back since it is sealed.\", \"I've got two of these and they're fantastic. I bought a new guitar recently and I was very worried when I noticed that the nitro-cellulose finish was very delicate and that it often reacted with materials found on guitar stands. After a lot of reading and research I settled on the Genesis stand because the manufacturer was explicit about the padding materials used.\\n\\nThe stand folds up into a very small package and it's one-piece so there are no parts to lose if you travel with it. I've used them for guitars and basses of all sizes with only some minor problems (see below). The stand is tilted back and the legs spread wide and it feels very, stable.\\n\\nThere's a little strap that you can use to secure the part that holds the neck and some notches to store pickups.\\n\\nThe only problem I've encountered is that the spread of the bottom 'arms' makes it awkward to use for some guitars that don't have symmetrical bodies. For example.. some basses, etc.\", \"I needed a shallow rack to replace my standard SKB roto rack case and the Gator GR-4S works great. The front and back openings on SKB shallow rack were different so I purchased the Gator instead. It arrived quickly but I did notice a flaw in craftsmanship. The threaded rack rails are not built into nor bolted to the unit. They're glued on. Once I removed the screws to insert my gear, the glue threaded rack rail fell off. I had to leave in one screw on each side of the rack until I secured my gear and then I removed the unwanted screws. The SKB threaded rails are bolted onto the rack unlike the Gator rack. Even though differences between Gator and SKB are minor, I wanted to bring this to your attention.\", 'I purchased this case to put a computer in it.  Gator cases are very high quality and they are very durable.  I would not buy any other brand.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to transport gear around.', \"The first one Ordered was defective. The handles on both sides came off/apart, and when the equipment was loaded, there was a noticeable, angled gap that you could see when looking at the equipment from the front. Returned first one for a replacement and the 2nd one has been out a couple of times without incident. The overall design and look is solid and appears to offer good protection. There is an even smaller gap once equipment is installed, but it's very minor. Product is extremely lightweight and both front and rear doors line up perfect to close the unit. My DBX Driverack PA, mic wireless receiver, and mics all fit nicely in box with wires that go to mixer. I am very pleased with the 2nd one so far.\", \"After only 3 months of use, one of the stands no longer supports my JBL SXR speaker. It just slides down to the lowest, unextended position within a matter of 20-30 seconds. Will be seeking warranty service but will sell immediately afterwards. I had my old On-Stage stands for 5 years, and although they weren't as nice looking or as promising as these Ultimates, they were always functional. Will buy another pair of On-Stage stands (and for much less too). Also, the Ultimate bag that holds a pair of these stands didn't fare so well in the 3 months either. Already holes and small nicks throughout. Disappointed.\", 'Bought these to get my church speakers up higher than the sub poles had previously allowed them to go.

Their durability is the best feature about them.  In fact the telelock mechanism is a great innovation too . . .\\n\\nHere\\'s the \"BUT\":\\n\\nI have to give them a poor rating on a few accounts.  First & foremost is that these stands rattle, and not softly.  I have 4 of them, and they all rattle.  The frequency range in which they rattle is roughly 69-98Hz.  The sound clearly comes from the telelock mechanism.  Since all 4 of the ones I have do this it can\\'t be coincidence, but instead poor design.  One of my stands has lost its \"grip\" to keep the pole slipping downward while the telelock is on the raise setting as well, but that\\'s just 1 out of 4 (you may be wondering why I have 4 - I work as a professional DJ, and it\\'s important to always have backups.  Therefore you always buy more than what you need.)\\n\\nHere\\'s the other huge problem with these stands - Ultimate Support\\'s support.  Currently I have a very nice rep working on the case for me who seems to be a little more proactive.  However, I called Ultimate Support over a year ago about the issue with the vibration in these stands.  I even sent an audio file to them where they could place a speaker on a stand, play the audio, and hear it for themselves.  I\\'ve had to call way too many times to attempt to get this issue resolved.  This is seriously unprofessional to drop the ball this badly.  Not only that, but I have another Ultimate Support product that was faulty from the start - a Jam Stand mic stand.  When I called more recently about my ts-90b\\'s I also brought up that the Jam Stand was defective.  The rep assured me that they would just send me a new one since it wasn\\'t worth it for me to send in the old one (admittedly it\\'s an inexpensive mic stand).  It\\'s been almost 2 months since the initial call was made where the jam stand was reported as defective, and I was assured I\\'d receive a replacement.  I have not even received a notice that a new stand was shipped.\\n\\nSeriously though, no follow up for over a year, and no resolution is simply unacceptable.\\n\\nAs stated earlier I have a rep who seems to be more proactive and diligent.  I\\'m hoping she will resolve this situation to satisfaction.  I will update my review after the outcome.  Until that time though, I would strongly recommend not purchasing anything from Ultimate Support.', \"I have owned two of this model poles since the 90's.  They've been used and abused and NEVER have let me down.  Solid and dependable.  I've had everything on them from Large 93 lbs speakers, to full light grids, to contemporary active tops.  These rule.\", \"I've had a silver pair of these without the leveling leg for a couple of years, and loved them. I really liked that I could raise my speakers up to 9-ft, so that the speakers weren't blasting directly in by-passer's ears, and so that the sound could more easily travel above the vehicles at the outdoor car shows that I frequently DJ. I was going to get another pair just like them, but then saw this new model with the leveling leg, and thought that was a *great* idea. Being able to adjust 1 leg makes it much easier, because otherwise you have to find a perfectly level spot for the stand, or prop up a leg with wooden blocks.\\n\\nThese stands are very sturdy, have a wide base, and can hold large speakers (I use them with a pair of 78 pound EV Sx-500s). I have never had any problem at all with these speaker stands (or the other set without the leveling leg). You can see both pairs in action in the attached photo.\", \"This is the best speaker stand I have gotten to date.  Lifts speakers above the audience's head - even when standing, and can be adjusted to make up for about 1' of uneven ground.\", \"The Ultimate stand is the best.  I've used many stands and Ultimate stands are the preferred to use always.\\nThe telelock is very durable.  The telelock makes the speaker easy to telescope higher or lower.\", \"I was looking for a stand with welded legs and all I could find were this one, the Proline, and probably the Hercules. I would not recommend any of the stands that you have to put together with bolts. Welded legs are much more accident/abuse-friendly. What sold me on this model over the Proline and Hercules is the offset attachment of the crossbeams on the legs. There is much more room for your legs. My PCR-500 fits on this perfectly and the height adjustment has plenty of settings to suit standing or sitting. I haven't had any trouble with my keyboard bouncing around.\", 'This is definitely the most stable, practical and good looking keyboard stand I have used. Both of my keyboard sit on them.', 'Great', \"Built like a rock. My keyboard weighs next to nothing but I didn't want it bouncing around. I have owned older, very heavy keyboards and this would handle any of them without breaking a sweat. Neither the rubber isolation bumpers nor the height adjustment device are very intuitive but if you play with them you can get them right within ten or so minutes and the height adjustment remembers your setting. Aside from the rubber isolators, this thing would last forever and is rock steady.\", \"My husband cut the tops off to shorten the height and put the two accross pieces back onto the shortened legs.  This is to accomodate holding a DJ box instead of a keyboard height.  The rubber skid stoppers keep sliding off, which is annoying, and the end plugs fall out and we already lost two, otherwise it's a heavy, sturdy stand.\", \"What can I say? I like this little thing. I'm a DJ but I don't rock 2 turntables and a mixer anymore. Instead, I sold off one of my precious 1200s and kept the other one for ripping vinyl. That's why I needed a preamp. I picked this one, along with a few others, figuring to audition each one then keep my favorite. This one arrived first, sounds great, and is made in the USA so I didn't even bother auditioning the rest. The volume is nice and loud and I can even run it through my DJ controller's auxiliary input with plenty of volume (probably due more to the trusty Shure M44-7 cartridge that I use). Though it's all subjective, I noticed more definition through the whole spectrum of sound while using this device, as compared to running my 1200 through a Pioneer DJM-450 phono input. I'm half tempted to re-rip my vinyl collection all over again after auditioning this little preamp. Is it audiophile-grade? No, but it's more than good enough for my needs and would have to be better than any built-in preamp in any of the modern turntables available, or even most sub $1500 DJ mixers.\", \"Just as other reviews have stated, this preamp does the job and saves some room in your rig. Simple to use with no settings options, it converts your phono signal to go into your receiver.\\n\\nThe ONLY thing I have found a little annoying is the power light. Doesn't turn off unless you disconnect the power source from the unit. Otherwise, it has been flawless for me. Sounds great and does not heat up.\\n\\nReally the best option for the price.\", \"Works great for mid level listener like myself. Does exactly what it says it will. Have it hooked up to my Techics to feed sound to my Onkyo and no noticeable hum. I've played everything from 180gram to old 60s worn out records and all sound great.\", \"Plugged my vintage Thorens turntable into my 2004 Sony Receiver through the AUX input. Without this, there was BARELY any sound. With this, I get better sound, but still need to turn it up a bit. Going from a record to a CD on the stereo requires me to turn the receiver down first. I like the unit, I just wish it had a power switch since I don't play records often and it's always turned on.\", 'Easy to install.  I use the Rolls to connect a turntable to my computer then airplay the audio to the rest of my house.  Great for non-audiofiles.', \"I don't have any experience with other phono preamps, so I can't compare this to anything else. Best guess: the $500 preamps probably sound a bit better. But I have absolutely no complaints with this unit and consider it an excellent performer and a great value. Very satisfied. Would buy again.\", \"The product design is good.  As with the other rack sizes in the Gator portable product line (I own a Gator 8U portable also that gets moved with this unit), it makes moving rack gear tolerable by providing wheels and a pull-lever a la luggage designs. It's reasonably durable, though I only move it occasionally -- so far.  My complaint is in the machine tolerancing - specifically the screws provided don't work well when you install the equipment into the rack.  The screw holes don't line up well with the rest of the frame, and the Gator screws provided (they are provided, which is a plus) don't fit well.  I own > 4 of a well-known competitor's 12U racks and I found that the competitor's machine screws worked better, though larger washers are needed. Could be a problem with my particular unit's assembly, but the unit is too big to economically send back. Emails to customer service with Gator were not responded to, though I only tried once. Tip: measure your vehicle to determine whether this unit will fit; a 10U unit could be pushing the door opening clearances unless you've got a van or pickup.\", \"Solid, rolls well, fit good. Doors are tricky to get off until you discover which way is up...you have to flip it 90 degrees from the rolling position to put the case in the functional position. Not an issue, and makes the unit more stable than leaving it on it's wheels. Awesome case for the price. Rails in front and back.\", \"The wheels make moving my recording gear a lot easier.  Everything mounted easily, and I've had no issues with the handle or moving the thing around.  I'm deducting one star because of the inconvenience of removing and replacing the front and back covers.  They don't just come straight off like similar SKB racks.  To install a cover you have to lift the rack off the floor or table, connect the bottom edge of the cover by placing it 1/2 inch below it's final position and pulling it up into place.  Then you can fasten the latches at the sides and optionally set the key lock at the top.  To open it up you undo the lock and latches and then lift the entire rack off the floor or table so that you can drop the cover down 1/2 inch to disengage it from the rack.  In my case (pun intended) the front of the rack is 100% full of equipment, none of which have handles or anything to grab that would make it easier to lift the front of the rack up in order to engage the front cover.  The back is not full, so I'm able to reach in and lift the rack without too much trouble to engage the back cover.  Getting the front cover off is a pain as the whole rack is about 40 lbs and I've got vacuum tube equipment that I don't want to bump around.  Since I don't typically use the locks, I'm considering removing the mechanism at the bottom of the covers that acts somewhat like a hinge to make the locks effective.  I'm happy with just the side latches holding the covers in place.\", 'This case might be okay if you are just transporting things from the trunk of your car to a gig, but this case is not worth considering if you plan to fly with it. First of all, the latches are both flimsy and exposed to shearing on both sides. This case has been through about 4 round trips, and already one of the latches is bent and coming apart. The latches can easily open during travel, so tie wraps are a must in order to secure them into place.\\n\\nThe case itself is okay, fairly light duty and the power strip is of nice quality.\\n\\nThis is not a professional product.', 'GREAT RACK!', 'I bought this in a quest to reduce weight in rig and to make things easier to haul around.  This works great and is DEEP.', 'This case was great to stuff all my FX and stomp boxes in, and have a drawer for storing stuff. I liked how the lids had aluminum valance all round for a snug fit. I lug all my own gear so it gets looked after but the first plane trip I took it on the TSA wrecked the damn thing! I left it unlocked too! They ripped off one of the latches, cracked one of the wheel arches and put a hole in one of the lids. Basterds. It still worked after that but I ended up getting a sturdier rack instead.', \"I like this rack and recommend it.  Using it to encase a Hartke Kilo bass amp that requires 3 U's.  Also have a 1 U fan, 1 U tuner, and 1 U power conditioner.  Using support panels from the back to support the fan and the power conditioner.  Had no problem with the front and back rack holes lining up correctly.  Everything fit well.  Wheels appear to be soft plastic so the jury's out on how well they'll hold up over time.

After doing some research, I decided to try the SM58 BETA.  Glad I did.  Another great Shure mic!

That\\'s about the best thing I can say about the Beta 58.  It can take a beating and probably not fail.  The sound quality will suffer as several beat up Beta 58\\'s I\\'ve used sounded like there was a rag wrapped around the mic but it got the job done in a pinch.\\n\\nAs I started working with other vocalists who brought their own mics to shows, I noticed that none of them really used the beta 58.  Most of them preferred either the EV ND767a, the Sennheiser e935a or the Sure Beta 87a.  The differences between these mics and the \"house 58\\'s\" was astonishing... even 58\\'s in very good condition (never been dropped or abused) did not sound as clear as the EV/SENN\\'s.\\n\\nThe biggest difference though is the feedback from stage monitors.  The Senn and EV both have much better feedback rejection than any of the 58\\'s I\\'ve seen.\\n\\nAll in all, I\\'ve been pretty underwhelmed with the 58.  For around the same price there are much better choices.\\n\\nI know that different venues, singers, PA setups, different stage monitors, etc all can affect how a mic performs but my observations are based on hearing pretty much the same traits over and over so they are not based on isolated incidents and I also base this all on the performance of new or like new 58\\'s, not the beat up ones.', \"This mic is amazing, what more can I say.. I like it better than my $300 studio mic.  This mic does not get muffled when you get too close to it.  It's  bright, clear and detailed.  Absolutely the best vocal mic I've ever owned.  It is now my GoTo mic for vocals.\", \"This mic is perfect for me. If you like to have the mic right up to your lips this is for you. Much better than even the SM58. I got mine from a local store and when I got it I hooked up our church's SM58 and the new beta. Made sure each channel was dialed in exactly and even my picky(and cheap lol) wife could tell a dramatic difference to the highs and lows of my voice. I sang to songs to demo them. This is Amazing Grace by phil wickham and I Write the Songs by Barry Mannilow. Both songs just blew me away. The difference in the high longer notes and key changes was fantastic. And just to make it even better the low notes that I struggle with came across wonderfully too. If you know how to work the proximity effect with your setup prepare for applause. Google that if you don't know what it means! If the extra 60$ is bugging you get a demo unit or a like new used. If you can sing it's worth it.\", \"The Shure SM58 is a good microphone. I can't even recall when I began using them, around the late 70's. It was rare to find a stage that didn't have any SM58's on it.\\n\\nSomewhere back around the early 80's neo-d was being used in audio magnets to increase the amount of magnetism per unit of weight. In speakers, this would hold the voice coil tighter providing less movement, and this accomplished one major thing. The ability to use rubber surrounds in ported cabinets, allowing the backside of the cones frequencies within the cabinet to escape at a tuned frequency range, unlike the old sealed cabinets. One reason for the sealed cabs was that the air pressure within the cab kept the cone from over extending and now this could be accomplished with a stronger magnet.\\n\\nHow does this relate to this microphone you ask? It doesn't, except for the potential of micro gram weight reduction or higher SPL handling capabilities, and that's my point.\\n\\nIt was time for the big selling vocal microphones to get an upgrade and the popularity of neo-d was something that the manufacturer's could market.\\n\\nSo they took the popular SM58 and improved on it.\\n\\nThey tightened up the pickup pattern. This reduces feedback from the mic and those monitors that are only eight feet away, and that you can never get loud enough.\\n\\nThey improved the frequency curve. I've run sound at small clubs to outdoor concerts and you are always trying to get vocals to cut through the mix, without being completely on top of it. Just a little gain placed strategically in the high mids and the proper cut will accomplish this and Shure knew this.\\n\\nThey improved the capsule isolation. Even a mic on a stand needs this, it's how you will get low end feedback, because the vibration traveling through the floor will also travel up the stand and start the feedback loop. As a hand held, the microphone moves about in your hand or you switch hands or for whatever reason, this will decrease the noise of handling the microphone.\\n\\nFinally, they increased the output of the microphone. This is mostly needed when it's plugged into a poor input. But the sly devils could use this as a benefit of neo-d and why you should upgrade to the new Beta.\\n\\nThe original can actually have a preferable frequency curve for thin vocals, because it will naturally fatten them and many users won't need the extra gain of the Beta. Neither of these are reasons not to buy the Beta though.\\n\\nBecause in every way, the Beta is a superior design when compared to the original. When you purchase a vehicle you know darn well that the cheaper model will get you back and forth to where you are going and that the more expensive model will please you even more while you're doing it.\\n\\nThe only downside to the Beta is the cost and that it might actually be a better mic than what you need.\\n\\nAt a cost of about 35% more, you just have to decide which vehicle you'd rather drive and which microphone you'd prefer your vocals coming from. I prefer the newer design, but a microphone is a tool that I've used for over 30 years to make a living.\\n\\nRecommended\", 'i have been using this mic for some time now in the band i play in. it works great', 'Good!', 'I use it to record on pro tools', 'good', 'How can you not like the BEATA 58?

It does and keeps on working.  Previously he had a used SM58 (the workhorse of the industry) and he destroyed it.  It was about 20 years old when I bought it and I can't believe it lasted as long as it did with the abuse he gives microphones.  This one is standing up to the abuse even better.  I'm sure it will last many, many years. Personally, I use the Beta 57 as I like the smoother sounds for vocals.\", \"We (my band) have been using 57's and 58's and they're good mics.

If you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost, go for the Beta.  I would buy this again.\", \"Why drive a Pinto when you can drive a Cadillac?

It really does make a huge difference.  I made alongside of her once with an Audix (more like a regular 58) and the sound alone was the difference between a pro and an amateur.  For live singing, this mic is the way to go.', 'best vocal mic for live performance , great sound, lots of gain without feedback, built like a truck,  kk kk', \"I have one of these, as well as several other microphones. The SM58 is a good all around mic - the reason it's an industry standard/go-to, but the Beta 58A is a better (in my opinion) vocal-specific mic...basically giving (again, in my opinion) a higher quality sound. The SM58 by comparison sounds muffled/muddy, where the Beta58A is clearer, stronger, and more articulate. If you're used to the SM58, then the Beta58A can sound thin and harsh, but, that is adjustable at the board - end result is that it's a tighter sounding mic with more clarity.\\n\\nPattern-wise, it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds - I play drums and use this mic for that reason, is that it picks up less of my drums than a SM57 or a SM58.\", 'The Beta 58A along with the original SM58 are industry standards, that\\'s well known. As a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there. Quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics. In fact, I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that I played at just recently.\\n\\nI had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. The Beta is definitetly hotter, with a more sensitive response. Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy, muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.\\n\\n\"Built like a tank\" is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shure\\'s vocal mics truly earn that title. They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. Toss it around, drop it, bury it under other stuff, etc., NO problem. When you are maintaining a bunch of music gear, it\\'s nice to have tools that you never worry about. For that reason, I\\'d highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal. Chances are, its in working order no matter what.', \"I'm an amateur sound tech.

The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin. That is, the Beta 58A, in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it, has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues. For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or, really, any) notes the Beta is a dream. This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or \"popping\" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it.\\n\\nWhile I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon, I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment. Quite honestly, I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations. The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin, the SM58, but it is worth every penny.

But the DM80 is, and I know this sounds weird, fantastic for live vocals. I randomly tried it one night at a bar gig in an impossibly muddy-sounding room where even my Shure Beta 57 wasn\\'t cutting through on vocals, and it instantly stood out. You have to scoop the mids and boost the highs a bit (but not as much as you\\'d think) and suddenly the average male tenor voice just jumps out. The mic also defies proximity effect and has a pretty wide on-axis pickup pattern, which is great for singing with your eyes shut (singers tend to wander from the mic when they do this) and for vocalists who think it\\'s sexy to get their lips all up in the grill, which usually makes a 58-style mic go boomy. I got a lot of weird looks from people in the audience who know vocal mics, but I also got a lot of compliments on how present the vocals were in a room that is notorious for being terrible for understanding lyrics.\\nThis mic also shines on upright bass- you have to use a LOT of gain, but with a nice preamp and some compression (I use a UA LA610) you can get a killer tone by placing the DM80 just to the right (facing the bass) of the bridge at the very top of the F-hole, and close in to the body. This is very nice for recording upright live in a room with other instruments because the null of the dynamic DM80 rejects outside noise nicely, and the lack of proximity boominess allows the mic to capture the \"wood\" tones of the bass without too much mud.\\n\\nI realize that this review is not really that helpful if you\\'re just looking for drum mics, but the DM80 is a workhorse that will always be in my bag.

The frequency response is 70~16,000 Hz, making this mic ideal not only snares, toms and cymbals, but also alto and tenor saxophones, trumpets and other instruments. And because it can be used close to sound sources, you can also mic amps with it.\\n\\nOne thing I like is the fact that it\\'s a dynamic mic that does not require phantom power. It can be used with an XLR cable or an XLR with a 1/4\" adapter for the mixer end. But the main thing I like is the performance for the price.

Danelectro pedals are awesome... the purple delay they make is also an amazing pedal called the \"Dan Echo\" I believe. This tremolo can change your life...', 'I have to say that this is one great pedal, and that Danelectro is a great company.  I had previously purchased their \"French Toast\" Octave distortion pedal and that one came with a \"knobs protector\", basically a clear plastic cover that slides down over the \\'fins\\' on the pedal body to prevent the knobs getting trampled.  Well, this one came without the protector.  The instructions said to go to a parts website to order a cover but that was no longer available from the website. One quick email to Danelectro requesting one, and *POOF*  they sent a protector to me at no cost.  That\\'s the kind of service that I appreciate and I will brag on Danelectro all day long.  Now, as for the pedal itself:  Works like a charm, just as good as a $100.00+ pedal from the big- name brands.  Sweet tremolo with a wide swath of depth and frequency.  Everything sounds good, from the \"Monkees Theme\" to Pink Floyd\\'s \"Money\".  My next purchase is Danelectro\\'s Cool Cat vibe pedal, and I will post a review for that too.  If it is even close to the Univibe it\\'s worth it, since it is a fraction of the price of the big-names.

The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link.  I don't think it's true bypass either.

The Vintage One came with a large Conn double case, which my seventh-grader does not need.  I tried the Vintage One in a Protec hard case from the same store and it fit perfectly, and the case has some room in the outside fabric cover for a mute or two, so I bought that case and returned the Gator case to Amazon.

The tremolo effect is nice and can be adjusted to give the Rhodes a bit more \"life\" in its sound.  However, after what seemed like a short time, I noticed that I had a lot of amplifier hiss with the pedal turned off and the output volume had gotten really low.  The battery was almost used up by this point.  The good news is that after I connected a 9 V power supply to the pedal, the hiss went away and it was back to working really well with good output volume.  A power pack is pretty much mandatory with this pedal.  A 9 V battery has way too short a lifetime to be useful.

If you use a cotton scarf or towel, that will also be useful to dry moisture that escapes from inside when playing and the like.\\n\\nWith this Gator case I like the ABS shell rather than fabric, the metal clip closures rather than zipper and the shoulder strap with its well-designed clips which puts the handle in just the right spot for me to be able to guide the case if necessary. This is not totally lightweight but considerably lighter and more maneuverable than my Gard case which I like but is a tank. I also like that this case is designed with little feet to sit on a flat surface although its body is curved. It will even stand upright on feet, which from experience I know is a good feature at a space-challenged situation. (Note I would stand it upright only when the instrument is not in it, say at a rehearsal, due to the inherent instability of that position. Or I might stand it in upright position if it could be securely wedged or roped to prevent a tumble.)\\n\\nAnd the price is right.', 'Secure case.  Love being able to sling it over my shoulder.

I have been drumming and writing music for 25 years, and have always wanted to play guitar. I almost lost my life a few years ago, and for my daughter to get this starter guitar for me as a gift for Christmas has absolutely changed my life! What a gift! I started lessons both on-line, and with a personal coach. Now for the review...I am a newbie, but I will try to stay away from \"guitar talk/technical jargon\", or at least define the typical terms you might see in a review.\\n\\n1. The guitar has incredible action. This means how high the strings are set from the fret board and how hard you have to press down to play notes or chords. You don\\'t need to press down hard at all, and anyone, even kids, should have no problem playing notes. Acoustic guitars are usually set with a higher action making them a little harder to play. It was pretty much in tune right out of the box.\\n\\n2. The guitar is BEAUTIFUL! I got the black bodied guitar. There is no pick guard (a piece of plastic that lays directly on the body of the guitar that protects it from scratches from the pick. Is that a con? It can be yes if you play it alot, you will start to see some marks from strumming. Not a deal breaker, this is a starter guitar.\\n\\n3. It wasn\\'t quite staying in tune, and the strings seemed a little weak to me. I have MANY friends in music, and I took it in to Music-Go-Round where my friend works. He was blown away at the quality of this starter guitar! My guitar instructor was also blown away! That speaks volumes as both have been playing for 25-40 years, and both have many guitars. My friend just threw on a new set of D\\'Addario EXL110BT Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Balanced Tension Regular Light, 10-46, and it is now staying in tune. A new set of strings is between $5-$7, so not really a big deal. It is now staying in tune.\\n\\n4. Has a 3 way switch to change which \"Pick-ups\" are activated when playing. I have a Fender Deluxe 112 Plus Amplifier, and let me say, when I plug in this guitar, it just sounds incredible! It plays so well! The average person would not recognize that you\\'re playing a starter guitar. My daughter got me the player pack combo which came with the guitar, a head stock tuner (a tuner which clips right on the head or top of the guitar and allows you to tune to the specific standard guitar tuning, EADGBE), guitar cable to plug in to an amp, a 10 watt amp, picks, a guitar strap, and a \"gig bag\" which is a soft case. An incredible value, and she got it right here on Amazon! I would recommend getting a hard shell case if you take your guitar places as a \"gig bag\" tends to throw the guitar out of tune. Not too much of a big deal because it came with the head stock tuner.\\n\\n5. It arrived very well packaged, they really protect the guitar, absolutely no damage. I have been so happy since getting this gift, and knew it was a good enough guitar to start lessons with an instructor. Definitely worth the money. If you are on the fence, take the leap, you will not be disappointed, especially for someone who is just starting out on the guitar journey.\\n\\nI plan on upgrading to a Gibson Les Paul in the future, one can never have too many guitars! LOL!', \"I've ordered these in 3, 3.5 and 3.5+ (that one was purchased by mistake).  So far I've had many good reeds from this batch.

What I didn't realize is that I needed to go an octave UP and this is rightfully an OCT-1 and -2 respectively.  I tried to tweak as much as I could (I put this on my higher EQ'd signal split), but didn't get what I wanted.  Additionally, when I used both outputs (direct and processed) the combined sounds were synthesize-sounding and way off from what I needed.  I opted, instead for the Joyo Octaver/Fuzz which worked perfectly for me.  I would think this would just work better for a guitar.  Bass gets complicated when you're messing with octaves (especially DOWN octaves).\", 'Using these for a Trembita 218 \"Kobza\", I\\'ve found that the sound is a little too bright.\\nQuality is good, though, so although these strings don\\'t really do it for me, they\\'re certainly not something I\\'d toss in the trash.  The Kobza has a sort of Cittern shaped body, so the acoustical properties are probably a bit different than the average 12 string.', 'Great sound and crisp clarity!!!! Awesome!!!', 'Amazing realy good buy now', 'quality strings', 'My high rating is not for the quality, but for the VALUE of these inexpensive guitars. With few notable exceptions, (i. e. hand made custom guitars) absolutely ALL new guitars require set up. Any reputable dealer should do some set-up before selling a guitar. Although when you buy a guitar via mail, you\\'re unlikely to receive that service.\\n\\nBut even with a cursory set up, each guitar will change over time. Wood moves. It will expand and contract. Frets bulge from the neck. Someone will need to do those adjustments and minor repairs. Would YOU risk working on a fine instrument without the best tools and plenty of experience?\\n\\nMy reasoning is, EVERY kid who wants to play guitar also wants to modify it. I\\'ve been teaching for over 40 years. In all that time, almost every youngster or teenager puts stickers on his-her guitars, draws on them, tattoos them, refinishes or carves them! You wouldn\\'t want them to do that to a fancy expensive instrument.\\n\\nAlso, every guitarist must eventually learn how to work on his guitar: restringing at a minimum, but adjusting action, making small electronic repairs or upgrades. Bolt-neck imported guitars like these (or Squire) are wonderful platforms for learning that craft without fretting about destroying a fine instrument. (Fretting... ha!)\\n\\nIf your young guitar enthusiast wants to learn re-fretting, that\\'s much easier to do on a bolt on neck with no binding like this. Want to hear the difference between pro-pickups and these inexpensive imports? Swapping pickups is an inexpensive upgrade. Even less expensive is trying different capacitors or potentiometers. Your fledgling guitarists may become a computer whiz kid in the future. Some electronic knowledge and basic soldering skills will give him a \"leg-up.\"\\n\\nThe fact is, a good guitar technician can make one of these cheap guitars play almost as well as an expensive one. You won\\'t have the bragging rights, but you will have a useable guitar that sounds good and inspires practice.\\n\\nWith just a few inexpensive tools, any kid can learn to level and dress frets. During that learning process, he will make mistakes, but those are also inexpensive to repair and provide a crucial learning lesson: NO ONE gets it perfect the first time. Only consistent daily effort brings improvement. What parent wouldn\\'t want their kids to experience that crucial life lesson?\\n\\nIt is no longer speculation, but a well known fact that music lessons improve other scholastic scores because only daily practice improves any new skill. It doesnt matter if that skill is playing rock and roll, or practicing math. Do it every day, and you WILL improve. Learning music helps inculcate that great life lesson. Learning to fix and personalize your own guitar makes that lesson deeply engrained yet FUN!\\n\\nNO, as-is, this is NOT a great guitar, but it is plenty good enough for beginners to learn with. With a few tweaks here and there, these can be made to play as easily as pro-guitars so they don\\'t hurt young fingers. And if you consider all the other factors in a child\\'s development, these may be a better choice than funding an expensive guitar.\\n\\nOver the decades, I\\'ve repaired, adjusted and modified hundreds of student guitars and taught hundreds more how to do their own guitar work. That is one advantage electric guitars like these have over other instruments. You would not want a kid to mess around with a grand piano or a fine violin or classical guitar.\\n\\nFurther, the young student can express his individuality, learn to be self reliant, and learn the great lessons of relentless steady effort. Some may think sports provide some of those life lessons too, but with guitar, you don\\'t risk critical injury or regular public humiliation. What could be better for your kids?\\n\\nThese and the Squire brand guitars are a great positive gateway instrument that brings life-long appreciation for music and craftsmanship. They can be a springboard toward learning electronics, circuit design and even some computing basics.\\n\\nIf you are clever and know an experienced guitarist / teacher, you or your kids can learn about economics, how businesses make compromises at different price points, and what is REALLY valuable in instruments. You might just learn what is valuable in life too.\\n\\nTHAT is why I love cheap guitars like these, and this particular model is one of the best for all those noble goals.', \"I collect guitars I bought this for my son with Rocksmith.

I have used it with bass and guitar, and generally speaking, it tracks ok and if used with the right technique, you can get some cool synthish sounding tones from either bass or guitar. The weakness of the OC-2 is that you can't really add the extra low octave because it farts out and does not track in the lower registers on bass. With the OC-3, I thought that perhaps Boss had solved this problem. I found a used one that ended costing me 15 dollars with some other trades. With the bass, the OC-3 is muddier and harder to hear compared to the OC-2. I used it mostly on the poly setting. The lower notes track, but they all sound kind out of tune. The controls are just not that intuituive also. I am glad I kept my OC-2 because I will be going back to it as soon as possible.

Good sustain after extended use. Nice ring response to the pick; still a fair tone response to bare fingers. Slurs could be better, but, it is a 12 string. Good price.

With that said, no, they are not that good of quality, and there tone is absolutely horrible. But I would still recommend them based on what your looking for.\\n\\nYour looking at 6 dollar strings, what could you possibly expect? Chances are your either a broke musician, such as myself, or working on a project 12 string and trying to minimalize cost when going into it. For the 6 dollars, and the fact they are eligible for Prime(or super saver shipping) they are worth it.\\n\\n12 string guitars are expensive to maintain, that much is very true. You need a new bridge from time to time, a sturdier case, and the cost of strings is usually around 20 dollars for a decent set. The problem lies in the fact that very few people play a 12 string anymore for serious music. That makes it incredibly hard to justify spending the extra money on strings. 12 strings now are used primarily for people either recording and looking for a unique sound, or just messing around with one in your local coffee shop. If you are looking to record, go elsewhere. Drop about 15 more dollars and get yourself some Elixirs or higher end Martins and get something that resonates. These sound dull almost immediately out of the package. But if you are in the second camp, and just want something that plays, then these are an excellent solution.\\n\\nAll in all, I knew what I would get. I did not expect much, and I did not get much. If your thinking you just found one of Amazon's hidden gems though, you did not. What you did find however, is an excellent set of strings for simply playing, either for yourself, or with a group. Just keep in mind that these are cheap strings, and you will not regret the purchase. Happy Playing.\", 'Purchased primarily for Rocksmith and it works very well for that.  Still learning how to play, but like the feel of this guitar.  Looks great and plays great.  Was packaged very well.  Only needed minor setup adjustments. I would recommend getting strap locks.', \"that's the perfect not expensive , very light , however, not sounds like crap. but she attracts dust so much. should wipe or clean frequently\", \"I don't own this guitar personally but I have spent time playing a friend's, and it's a decent guitar.  It's really not bad and it's a solid beginner's guitar with some room for improvement.  I found the neck to be decent, the pickups workable, and overall build pretty solid.  But that's it.  For nearly $300 you get a decent guitar that nearly every other beginner ever has used at some point.\\n\\nAll of which is fine, and I could end my review here.  But odds are, if you're seriously looking at this guitar, you're a beginner or intermediate player, perhaps looking for an upgrade from your Squier Bullet Strat or cheap Wal-Mart acoustic.  This is an extremely popular model because it's made by a subsidiary of one of the most famous guitar companies in the world.  And if you're like I was at one point, you might not have even heard of any of the comparable alternatives.\\n\\n1)  Schecter\\nI own a Schecter Omen 6, purchased at $300 even, and it blows the Epiphone out of the water in terms of speed, playability, and sexiness.  It could have been the luck of the draw, but I do feel that Schecter makes a superior guitar at just a fraction of the cost more than this one.\\n\\n2)  Rondo Music\\nIf you are indeed a beginner, you probably haven't even heard of Rondo Music.  They aren't as well known because they spend nothing on advertising or brand naming.  All that money saved goes directly into quality, and boy does it show.  You have two general groups of options if you're looking for a Rondo alternative to the Epi LP-100:\\n\\na)  SX Callisto (or other SX) - SX guitars are made in China and can be found ridiculously cheap (the most expensive custom models top out at $200) and will likely match, if not outperform, the Epiphone and save you $100 as well.  I just ordered an SX Callisto Custom at $160 yesterday - it has a set neck compared to the Epi's bolt-on, block inlays compared to the Epi's dots, quilted maple top compared to the Epi's plain top, and at under 2/3 the cost.\\n\\nb)  Agile - Rondo's Agile guitars are less common than Epiphones, but have developed quite a cult following, for good reason.  An Agile AL-2500 series guitar (see pic) costs between $250 and $300 and will typically match an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Plus top, which runs about double the cost.  Go even higher up, and an Agile AL-3200 will compete with Gibsons and Fenders - without paying for the name (or American labor costs).\\n\\nThis isn't to trash the Epiphone.  It's a decent guitar and generally quite solid and reliable.  If brand name means a lot to you, then by all means, get the Epiphone.  I simply feel that you're putting at least a hundred dollars into the name on the headstock, and that there are definitely better alternatives at the price that you should check out.\\n\\nQuick takeaway - Unless the name on the headstock means everything to you, an Agile AL-2500 is a far superior guitar at about the same price.\\n\\n(Absolutely no compensation was given from Schecter or Rondo music - I just happen to like their products and wanted to share some advice to make the world a better place!)\\n\\nHope I was able to help you out, good luck with all your guitar endeavors in the future :)\\n\\n- Matt\", 'My axes\\nEpiphone LP Studio deluxe plustop\\nFender Marauder\\nTakamine G320\\nSquier Standard Strat\\nSquier Standard PJ bass\\n\\nBeen playing 20 years.\\n\\nI had a Squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar I didn\\'t care about that I could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with. But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith. I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for $130 and they kicked in free strings.\\n\\nBought it for a game, but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good, played so well, and had a killer tone.\\n\\nMy LP Studio had it\\'s pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 81/85\\'s which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have. Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain, tone, and playability. Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier, it is easily twice the guitar for that price. You literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the Special 2.....\\n\\nSound: 5/5\\nTwo passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs, deep lows, and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.\\n\\nThe pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.\\n\\nThe pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic. Not sure which they have.\\nSo much sustain for a bolt on neck. I was shocked.\\n\\nBuild Quality 4/5\\n\\nI did have 1 problem with the high E tuner. I didn\\'t notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4\" up out of the headstock. When I discovered this I loosened the string, whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.\\n\\nIntonation required no adjustment.\\nAction was exactly the way I like it\\nNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.\\nThe finish was perfect. No nicks, blemishes, just oily black goodness.\\nNeck was flush with no gaps or seams, and professionally shimmed. Damn good for a bolt on.\\nHardware is typical for the price but does the job, stays in tune very well.\\nBack bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.\\nThe bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup. Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts, IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.\\nWeird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it.

It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box. IT\\'s well built, plays well, and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music. The frets are medium jumbo\\'s and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet (2 squiers in this price range).\\n\\nI would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music. I did blues, metal, country, and pop. The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender, not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.\\n\\nOne thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge. This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain. I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the way.\\n\\nAs an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it. What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE. The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower, still no hum but you wouldn\\'t fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil. I ended up putting the screws back in.\\n\\nI will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here I come!) and move my EMG 81/85\\'s in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor, buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar. It\\'s cheap enough that you won\\'t care if you bang it around a little, and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years.', \"This is a great beginner guitar, but the slimmer, lighter body may be disconcerting to players looking for a low-price Les Paul replica. Here are my impressions of the LP-100:\\n\\nPros:\\n- Price point - this is a smoking price for a very cool guitar\\n- Humbuckers sound pretty decent, though not as good (to my ears) as the Epiphone LP Standards\\n- Paint looks great, has classic LP shape\\n\\nCons:\\n- I don't love the clean tones\\n- Doesn't feel sturdy (although many reviews I've read say this is a misperception about the LP100)\\n- Doesn't feel right if you're used to playing a Les Paul Studio (or better)\\n\\nI would buy this if I was learning to play - I think it could be a comfortable guitar to learn on, but I find it's playability lacking. Or more specifically, I find it playable, but not fun to play.\", \"Love it.  The sound is big.  It has plenty of adjustments and you can play your heart out.  It's pretty too.\", 'The Epiphone Les Paul 100 is a lot of guitar for the money. First of all it has two wonderful humbucker pickups (at the bridge & neck), separate volume & tone controls for each pickup and of course the classic Les Paul 3-way toggle to select bridge pickup, both Bridge & neck, or neck pickup. It has a bolt-on neck (rather than a glued neck) which IMO is not a bad thing, it is a bit thinner than your typical Les Paul which makes it light (a good thing). Still for the $250-$300 usually paid for a Les Paul 100, you get proper tuners (which are very good) a nice finish (mine is Hertitage Cherry Sunburst) and the wonderful Les Paul sound in a well-constructed, nicely-crafted guitar. The 12\" radius neck feels wonderful, and I found no sharp fret-ends on the rosewood fretboard. All controls work just as they should (volume, tone, pickup selectors) and the tones this guitar is capable of are wonderful.\\nThis is a guitar that although it is value-priced, it isn\\'t and doesn\\'t look, feel or sound \\'cheap\\'. It\\'s a guitar you can happily play for many years  and want to keep.\\nWhat you don\\'t get on this guitar that you might get on a higher priced guitar is as previously mentioned - a glue-on neck (this one is bolted on) fancy large inlayed fret markers (this has the usual dot markers common on many guitars) and binding on the body. The later two are more cosmetic than anything and doesn\\'t change the fact that this guitar looks & sounds wonderful.\\nI own many more expensive guitars, but I find that the Les Paul 100 is a very enjoyable guitar to play. My 8 year-old daughter refers to it as my \"pretty\" guitar, and indeed it is very nice-looking. The proof is in the playing, and this is a guitar that you won\\'t want to put down. The lighter weight also makes playing very enjoyable and I\\'ve yet to experience a sore back playing (the weight is one of the reasons I choose this over other Les Paul models).\\nDon\\'t let the reasonable price fool you - this is a very good guitar that you won\\'t be sorry you purchased -not a month from now, not a year from now & most likely you\\'ll still be enjoying it years & years from now. It\\'s that good & it\\'s a great value. Highly recommended!', \"I thought I'd gotten a good base guitar, you know one you can get cheap and make it scream as you get the money.

I haven't installed them yet because when I bought a digitech rp360,,,,,well didn't need too,  It screams on its own now...crystal clear.  no muddy tones.  I am in love with this guitar.

I have written a review on this guitar just after I purchased it and now it\\'s been over a year and I still stand by my positive review. I own about 8 guitars now and this guitar is one of two of my favorites. My other favorite is a Dean electric 12 string.  When I hold and play this Epiphone Les Paul special 2 guitar it feels and sounds like something I could take on stage but it doesn\\'t have the cost associated with a Gibson. What\\'s also amazing is that it\\'s still around a $150. It\\'s well worth the noney. It stays in tune and it high quality. Well worth the money. I just purchased an electric/acoustic Epiphone ukelele today for my Chiropractor. I will review that later. If you are looking for a Les Paul guitar this is not one. Not his typical style although Amazon does sell one for about $250 so don\\'t let the name fool you. It\\'s still a very nice guitar though. Very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners. I highly recommend this guitar. Buy it!  Thank you.', \"I've been doing acoustic guitar for 20 years mainly church worship, rhythm guitar stuff. I decided to try an electric so I could move a little faster and play bar chords without straining my hand. For starters this guitar looks great. It also sounds good and stays in tune. My thinking was I would buy something cheap and see how I liked electric guitars in general. This thing is quality galore and it has given me a renewed love of guitars. I've been getting back into lead stuff and paired it with an RP55 effects box and have just been having a ball.\", 'Perfect', 'As a \"Starter\"\" guitar or as a legit back-up it\\'s hard to beat the LP-100 for the price.  I was a complete newb when I bought this model 5 months ago - took it to a friend who\\'s been playing for 30 years and he was really impressed with everything about it.  As a result of having such a good time learning on this one I upgraded 3 weeks ago to an Epiphone Les Paul Standard Red Royale Model.  I got the LP-100 back out last night for the heck of it and am Still impressed with it. Had thought about selling it when I got the new Epi LP but I think now I will hold on to it awhile!!  I purchased Black with cream colored trim then swapped out some of the trim for black and blue', \"Like the title of the review says, this guitar is really an incredible bargain. I got it for my first guitar ever (specifically the package that comes with a cheap starter amp, guitar strap, and everything) and I always find myself coming back to it. For the price it can produce some wonderfully crushing heavy sounds, especially with tuned down 12-gauge strings. The neck pickup is low and heavy without getting that muddy, and the bridge pickup is decently trebley without overdoing it or sacrificing rock tone.\\n\\nThe neck is nice and slim. It doesn't stay in tune as well as I'm sure an expensive pro guitar would, but it's not terrible. Again I think it works impressively well for the low low price.\", 'First off, the shipping was fantastic. It shipped the very next day and came VERY well protected in perfect condition. It is an extremely well made and solid product. I think a few people have given this Les Paul a rep of just being a \"Starter Guitar\".

It even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp. I can\\'t say enough good things about this guitar it\\'s that good. If you\\'re thinking aout buying this guitar, don\\'t. Just buy it!! BUY IT!!', \"I wanted a Les Paul type humbucker sound at a reasonable price to compliment my 1973 Fender Stratocaster single coil sound. This filled my tonal needs perfectly at a ridiculously low price. I gave it a full setup and tightened the tuner hardware. This guitar has to be one of the great buys in the history of guitardom. I can't believe it only cost $250.00! I contemplated upgrading the tuners and the bridge hardware, but I don't think I will have to. It plays smoothly and sounds excellent as is. It looks beautiful too. Is it as nice as a $2500.00 Les Paul Custom? No, but it is 250 bucks!\", 'Very nice playability and sound for the price', 'Nice guitar plays great nice action', 'What an amazing guitar for the price. Very good quality and the sounds is very nice. It play perfectly with Rocksmith 2014, Behringer modules or pedals and my orange amp.\\n\\nThe only cons I can find now is the weight, it starts to get heavy after 3 or 5 hours standing up playing.', 'The Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar is a GREAT GUITAR for $169.00 (The average selling price at the time of this review). The pickups, tune-o-matic bridge and stop piece are the same ones used in Epiphone\\'s more expensive guitars, and are similar to what\\'s used in much more expensive Gibsons. Although the tone adjustments have been simplified to a toggle between the three pickup combinations and an overall tone control for both pickups, this is not as big a deal as many might make of it. Given the vast array of other things that influence electric guitar sound -- strings, amp choice and settings, effects pedals and so forth -- the guitar sounds great as is.\\n\\nThe finish and general fit and balance of the guitar are great. There was a time when budget guitars screamed cheap and were quite obviously low class in a lot of areas. Those days are past with the Epiphone LP Special II.\\n\\nAll that said, there a few things to remember.\\n\\n* The guitar comes with very light bendy strings. This is probably due to market data that tells Epiphone that the bulk of buyers for this guitar are teen Guitar Heros who think that string bending every note is an essential aspect of shredding and wailing. If you plan to put heavier strings on the guitar (like 12-51s for example) for jazz or other styles of music then you will probably need a truss rod adjustment to compensate for the added tension. If you don\\'t know how to do this, ask someone who does. You can ruin a guitar, permanently, by being too aggressive with a truss rod adjustment.\\n\\n* The guitar has a mahogany neck, but a basswood body. Do not let anyone tell you this is a bad thing. Basswood is a completely acceptable wood for musical instruments. It is not worse or better than mahogany or maple. It is just different. Once again, the differences involved will probably be irrelevant when added into all the other things that players do with amps, strings and pedals to create tone and sound from an electric guitar.\\n\\n* Epiphone has more than one factory making these guitars. One is in China, the other in is Indonesia. The guitars made by each are very close in every detail, but not exactly, perfectly the same.\\n\\n* The Chinese examples of the sunburst model that I have seen have a slightly golden-orange tone to the sunburst pattern, more like the traditional sunburst color in American guitars. The Indonesian examples I have seen have a much more over all orange look. Basswood does not have a lot of visible grain. The example guitar shown in the official Epiphone product photos, the photos you see on most web sites like Amazon and Musician\\'s Friend and so forth, are probably a little optimistic when it comes to visible grain and the golden hued quality of the sunburst finish.\\n\\n* The Chinese examples I have seen tend to weigh more. One Indonesian model I saw weighed a full pound and half less than the Chinese model right next to it. There is not, unfortunately, any way to tell from the box or from the barcode or SKU number on the box what factory a given example inisde the box came from. The system will deal out whatever is in stock at the moment.\\n\\nThe world is full of guys who will zero in on all the details they find inferior about this guitar by noting the rather obvious fact that this is not a Gibson Les Paul Standard costing $3,000.00. There are some people who will complain that this guitar has a bolt on neck. True, the set necks of the more expensive Epiphones and Gibsons are nicer. But, considering the fact that every Fender Stratocaster ever made had a bolt on neck, is this really a big deal? Would Jimi Hendrix have played \"Purple Haze\" better if his Strat had a set in neck? Probably not.\\n\\nThe guitar this model is probably closest to, in spirit and purpose, is not the Gibson Les Pauls but, rather, to the old Gibson Melody Maker guitars from the 60s. That said, this is a hell of lot more guitar for the money than any Melody Maker ever was, and adjusted for inflation, relative to what a Melody Maker would have cost you in 1968, for example, it is almost like Epiphone paying you to play it.\\n\\nPeople listen to music, not guitars. Music is made by players, not by pickups and electronics. If you\\'re on a budget, this is an outstanding choice. If you\\'re not on a budget, it\\'s still a very good basic instrument. RECOMMENDED.', \"Listen,If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability, buy this one.  Period.\\n\\nI bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work, in case the guys called for a practice session, so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.\\n\\nI have other, way more expensive guitars, like a Gibson ES-335, Dean 12 string, and a Fender Strat, but I gotta tell you, I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.\\n\\nAnd if it gets banged up, so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes, just for a cheap change up guitar.\\n\\nDig it.\", 'I have been playing for about 7 years now and have a Tak Jasmine Acoustic and a Jay Turser Strat knockoff.  I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price.  I\\'ve read just about everything I can on these Epi\\'s and finally went to my local Music store to try one out.  My initial impression was somewhat mixed.  The sound was good but the action seemed \"off\"  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar.  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for.  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat).  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish.  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit. Instantly I was in love.  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what I\\'m used to).  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated.  Tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway).  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar.  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body.  I point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and Gibson electronics.  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body).  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed, and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer. Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else, AND they will do a FREE setup for me after I\\'ve played it for a while (so far it\\'s been perfect out of the box).', 'Went to local place to check out hands-on.  I was not impressed at all.  The thing just felt cheap.  I could not imagine playing it for long.  It was not fun to hold and parts looked cheesy.  Other than body shape, it was nearly identical to the Epiphone SG-Special Electric Guitar sold at the same price.\\n\\nI am surprised the Les Paul name was allowed to be used on this.', 'exactly the same as describe here, love the sound and easy to play. great price for excellent sound, highly recommend to everyone.', 'This guitar gives the Gibson vibe with he Epiphone feel and price. I love the guitar for its range, and it gives a wonderful tone. Definitely recommended...', \"The Epiphone company makes fine instruments to this day, and if you see the adds, having fine tuners may make you fall in love. Use your head. This model has fine tuners, but is not near the high quality as a epiphone standard Les Paul. The standard Les Paul is made like the very early Gibson Les Paul's with the same wood, and stats. Only thing missing on that model is the true 1957 pick ups you can buy from Duncan and they are exact Seth Love replications. And with the Standards, you would be wise to modify the tuning keys to non slip godins. Spend one hundred more, and you have a real Les Paul. Spend some 200. oo more on mods and you have a 1957 Les Paul like the big people. Keith\", 'This is a fine guitar, but it isn\\'t amazing.  My particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar - they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear-coat.  There\\'s one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick-guard mounts to the underside of the body.  Neither would be apparent to someone who wasn\\'t appraising the guitar, but they are there and don\\'t look normal to me.  Maybe I got the first one off the line after they switched from black-painted models?  My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn\\'t match at all - I\\'m guessing that it\\'s a joint that has been glued together.  I know that the better Les Paul guitars have a one-piece neck, and since I didn\\'t read about this one having something different, I assumed it would be the same.  Glue is stronger than wood and Les Paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area, so I guess my guitar should be more durable than some. Still, it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery.  I\\'m not sure that seeing these finish issues before-hand would\\'ve dissuaded me from buying the same guitar, but upon reflection it would\\'ve been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying.\\n\\nMy remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all Les Paul guitars versus my particular instrument.  The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap, even while sitting.  The top strap peg is angled up slightly, where guitars with horns have them angled down, which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a Les Paul - the pegs just don\\'t stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars.  It\\'s great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that \"real\" Les Paul guitars do, but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup.  The range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small, and I found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated .09 strings without additional hardware.\\n\\nThe guitar sounds decent, it looks pretty great (although not quite as pretty as the pictured one), and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars.  Note: the shorter scale length is characteristic of Les Paul guitars, it doesn\\'t indicate that this is less than a \"full-sized\" guitar.  Though this is a fine guitar for the price, I\\'m not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again.', 'I have owned several \"budget\" guitars and don\\'t fool yourself - this is a budget guitar.\\n\\nCompared to the Fender Stratocaster Squire or the Epiphone Les Paul Special 2; the Epiphone LP-100 severely outshines both in construction, tone, and overall quality. I wish I had known about this model before starting my guitar journey with a Fender Squire Strat Pack - which is absolute garbage even with a proper setup. What I thought would be a step up from that pile was an Epiphone LP Special 2; while it isn\\'t the worst choice it wasn\\'t a good one. That guitar was a plank of wood and the tone reflected that. Stear clear of those models. They will end up in a closet gathering dust. They both suck to play and I really do mean that.\\n\\nThe LP-100 on other hand is VERY impressive for the price and would be a good starter guitar for anyone interested in learning how to play. Looks wise, it begs to be taken off the wall and played. The iconic sunburst finish really shines, doesn\\'t look cheap at all, and can take a ding or two without showing. The sound is great, the humbuckers really sing, and the volume/tone knobs are responsive. String changing is a breeze and adjusting the action is also very simple given the tail piece and bridge are easily accessible. You can get a wide variety of rich tones out of this when coupled with a decent amp - I used a Fender Mustang 2 and not some silly mini speaker. In fact, if you are buying this for a gift or as first guitar for yourself do get a Fender Mustang 2 at around $100 on here. One of the biggest blocks for learning can be things not sounding right, Part of the equation to having a successful start with playing guitar is a combination of good equipment at the start. My recomended setup for those I give lessons to:\\n\\n-Epiphone LP-100\\n-Fender Mustang 2 amp (the bigger the better, don\\'t buy some mini cheapo POS)\\n-6ft Fender L-shaped cable for this particular guitar\\n-Dunlop Gator Grip picks ,58mm thickness or one of the variety packs\\n-Dunlop String conditioner - helps your strings last and helps condition the fretboard.\\n-Fretfast - helps slick up the strings and back of the neck.\\n-Ernie Ball slinky strings\\n-Chromatic Tuner (or if you have a smartphone there is an app called G-Strings and you will save a boatload of money)\\n-Floor or wall stand, brand makes zero difference until you\\'re playing on some $1K+ Gibson.\\n\\nWith that equipment you get the feel and sound you want from your equipment to keep you moving along.\\n\\nI have some \"better\" guitars in my collection such as a Fender Telecaster and an Epiphone Sheraton 2 but I keep coming back to this LP-100. I like the way it feels, the tone, the presence that it has overall. My only complaint with this guitar is the stock tuners/tuning pegs. It doesn\\'t hold D or C tunings for as long as I would like but that is minor when considering the overall quality of this great guitar. If you buy this stellar Les Paul and keep it around, plan on upgrading the tuners to Grover tuners for around $20-$30 and an hour of your time.\\n\\nTo conclude my ranty review; you cannot go wrong with an Epiphone Les Paul 100. If you\\'re a beginner, you will love it. If you\\'re more experienced, it will be a nice addition to your collection and put some variety in your sonic arsenal.\\n\\nDo not buy a Squire or a First Act, start off right or you are wasting your money. The LP-100 is hands down the BEST budget guitar I have played. New or used, it is worth the money if you are serious about learning.\\n\\nGo forth and SHRED \\\\m/', 'I\\'ve played string instruments for the better part of 55 years... Starting with a cheap Tijuana Wood box as a 5 year old, progressing to Martin 6 and 12 string Acoustic guitars, and a few electric Fender and Gibson units....

Finally settling on this Cherry Burst LP-100.\\n\\nIt arrived in perfect condition, the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding. It was even \"sorta\" in tune... but a quick dial-in with the electronic tuner brought that right.\\n\\nSimply put, Nice guitar.

Not only because it looked great but it also had a wonderful sound and great sustain! If you are looking into getting a beginner guitar around this price range, I recommend this one!!! I picked it up for only $169 and it seems like it should be worth like double that!!! I am a beginner and always wanted to play but didn't want to spend a load of money till I can justify it. I tuned it and have been using it on xbox guitarsmith 2014. Awesome!!!!\", \"I got this pretty fast. I took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief that I got this guitar for the price. First, the 'tuner' issues that I've been reading about. Replace the strings! I stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune. A set of D'Addario 10's cured that straight away (or whatever you prefer just change them). The tuners aren't the best but they are not to blame, it's the cheap strings. Now, technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box. The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it. I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut (Never had to do this to the nut on an electric, not even on a used guitar. The nut slot was cut too deep), as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable. It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most I've ever had to use. After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws. In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.\\nIf I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal. But as I'm looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work I'm steadily staring at the 'QC passed' sticker. Must have been built on a Friday afternoon or something.--- NOW--after I did this it is sweet!!. I play through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my Strat w/  Duncans and Dimarzios. The quality of the electronics is not sub par at all. After adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them,  I'd argue that this is as good as any Epi I've ever played as far as pups and all, so don't hesitate there because I don't really care for Epis and I'm in love with it. (I bought this to sell mainly, but now????)  The build quality; hmm, if you can do guitar work go for it. Otherwise I'd highly recommend a more expensive model.

For the 6 dollars, and the fact they are eligible for Prime(or super saver shipping) they are worth it.\\n\\n12 string guitars are expensive to maintain, that much is very true. You need a new bridge from time to time, a sturdier case, and the cost of strings is usually around 20 dollars for a decent set. The problem lies in the fact that very few people play a 12 string anymore for serious music. That makes it incredibly hard to justify spending the extra money on strings. 12 strings now are used primarily for people either recording and looking for a unique sound, or just messing around with one in your local coffee shop. If you are looking to record, go elsewhere. Drop about 15 more dollars and get yourself some Elixirs or higher end Martins and get something that resonates. These sound dull almost immediately out of the package. But if you are in the second camp, and just want something that plays, then these are an excellent solution.\\n\\nAll in all, I knew what I would get. I did not expect much, and I did not get much. If your thinking you just found one of Amazon's hidden gems though, you did not. What you did find however, is an excellent set of strings for simply playing, either for yourself, or with a group.

I\\'ve always wanted to get the Boss OD-2 because it has such a great and controllable classic natural sounding OD but it was discontinued.  I read about the OD-3 being a successor to the OD2 (with good reviews) and decided to get this pedal and just see how it fits in with what I do.  The OD-3 showed up a few days ago and I have been testing it out with it configured just about every way possible.  I like the tone at about 11:00 to 12:00 and the OD throughout the whole range.  I like the way it behaves (like a tube amp) with the notes still sounding pretty clean when playing lightly but growing dirty as you dig in harder.  I feel like this pedal completes the low to mid range of OD/distortion where the other 2 pedals cover the other end.  I would definitely recommend this pedal if you like classic rock and highly manageable levels of OD from clean to pretty ragged.  The tone at 11:00ish is very good for letting the lower notes stand out while also keeping the high end clear.  Going back and forth (pedal on- pedal off) I have it set where the natural tone (clean on amp) is close to the tone with OD on.  Then I just set the level to about what the other OD/Distortion pedals are at and then put the Drive knob wherever I feel like and it seems like it works for me throughout the entire range.  Some criticize it\\'s limited range of output sounds, where I feel like that is what I want.  Something predictable and easy to find the one sound I am looking for.

Unlike the Tubescreamer and the SD-1, the OD-3 really works as a standalone overdrive pedal.  It does not cut out all of the bass in your tone, and can get surprisingly high-gain if you turn it up.  Perhaps most importantly (and unlike the DS-1 and SD-1), it has tons of output on tap - this thing can easily achieve unity gain with your clean tone, or boost your signal even further.\\n\\nDescriptions of pedal \"tone\" are very subjective and hard to convey in words, but the best thing I can say about the OD-3 boosts your tone and adds fullness and gain without sacrificing transparency.  Your guitar will still sounds like your guitar - only on steroids.  That\\'s what a good overdrive should do.  I tried it with a Les Paul and it could handle everything from smooth blues to crunchy classic rock.  With a Stratocaster, however, it really comes alive.  You can get a lot of those great \"Stevie Ray\" or classic rock tones with a Tubescreamer boosting an already overdriven amplifier.  Or you can just plug in the OD-3 and get an equally awesome effect.  Pick attack is very well defined from note to note too - it\\'s an analog circuitry, but BOSS really did some nice work under the hood to refine it.\\n\\nBottom line: There are a lot of great overdrive pedals out there in today\\'s market.  If you want to pay $100+ for a Fulltone, Wampler, or even a Klon, those are very nice pedals.  But if you think the less-than-$100 OD-3 can\\'t hang with those, you\\'re kidding yourself.  Try it out - you might like it better than you think!', 'We are currently living in a time when guitarist have more options for overdrive pedals than there has ever been in the last 40 years. Overdrive is overwhelmingly the most popular guitar effect these days; even more so than distortion. Unlike distortion effects, overdrive allows more transparency in your sound so that you can hear the notes and chords that you play much better than you could with distortion or fuzz.\\n  Overdrive is a fairly simple circuit on the inside (especially compared to analog \\'chorus\\' or \\'flanger\\' effects), yet there are tons of overdrive pedals that cost well over $250.\\n  When I decided to finally add an overdrive to my setup, I spend about two years trying out different options. I was in no hurry, and I wanted to get a really good overdrive no matter the cost. Some of them were expensive (the \\'Klon\\' cost over $300), and some of them were much less. Unlike delay, modulation, and reverb pedals, in the world of overdrive effects, a correlation between price and quality isn\\'t nearly as strong as you might imagine it to be. You could spend as much or as little as you want and essentially get a decent product. This is because overdrive is overwhelmingly the most popular effect for guitar players.\\n\\n  But try and imagine my surprise when I tried out this overdrive in a music store a few months back out of nothing more than boredom, and couldn\\'t believe my ears! The OD-3 is an analog overdrive that retains as much or as little bass as you dial in, it\\'s dead silent when it\\'s engaged and you are not playing (the signal to noise ratio is \\'-115db\\'), the construction feels very solid, and it even features the classic early 80\\'s larger black BOSS knobs with a funky school bus yellow-ish orange paint job all over it.\\n  This is one situation where people will flat out refuse to like the effect because it\\'s BOSS, and it\\'s just not expensive (or hipster) enough at this point in the market. I have owned over a dozen different BOSS effects since I first started guitar and I think this one might by my favorite because it\\'s just such a sleeper hit! If you are willing to take a chance at not being considered \\'cool\\' by the \\'boutique\\' snobs, I highly recommend that you try out this pedal.\\n\\n  I like to give other guitar players a blind listening test by putting a pillow case over this pedal and letting them try it out while I dial in the tone they are after. They all go on and on about the transparency, the big bass, the gobs of sustain; but then when I remove the pillow case and show them that it\\'s a BOSS pedal they have been hearing: they usually end up screaming, stomping up and down, wetting their pants, and dismissing it with something along the lines of \"BOSS is just junk anyway!\"\\n  It would be funny how biased some guitar players can really be if it wasn\\'t so sad. I see it like this, I could buy any overdrive that I could possibly want and I picked this one over all the MAXON options (and there are a lot of MAXON overdrives). No other overdrive sounded near as good as this one and it just so happens to be one of the more affordable options available too.\\n  I recommend this over the BOSS BD-2 (which is more aggressive sounding, and a bit too \\'bright\\'/\\'tinny\\') and the BOSS SD-1 (which doesn\\'t offer near as much bass, and is a much more noisy pedal). BOSS really reclaimed their integrity with the OD-3, and I highly recommend it. Give it a shot!', \"It's really tough to beat this pedal if you're looking for a solid, inexpensive overdrive. It really shines with just a little bit of dirty, and has a nice crunch and thickness to it. The dual-stage overdrive circuit is very tube like after a little post-EQ tweaking.\", \"I have been playing for more than 30 years. I play through an Egnater Rebel 30 and a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe. Although both of these amps sound great on their own, this pedal adds yet another dimension. I gave up playing in clubs years ago and now I play primarily for my enjoyment and I write and record my original tunes in my home studio. Whether I am using an axe with single coils or hum buckers, this pedal shines. I have always felt Boss makes the best pedals and I have many Boss products. I also have some EH, Dunlop and MXR pedals. I used a Tube Screamer for a short while and never understood the hype it gets. This pedal blows the Ibanez out of the studio and off the stage. Don't know how it would work with a solid state amp but with a tube amp I'm confident that it will earn your respect.\", \"I love the idea that you don't need a pocket in your strap or elsewhere to store your pick.

But seriously, if you're a player who prefers pedals, you could easily spend thousands on boutique models (I've done it) and still not do that much better than the reasonably priced and unbelievably tough Boss pedals. I've talked to tone purists who say that these steal tone, muddy up the signal, etc... Eh, maybe there's some validity to this argument. But unless you're looking for ultra-pure, uncolored tube tone heaven, you would do well to go with a Boss rig, in my opinion. Here are some basic reasons why:\\n\\n1) Price is right.\\n2) The Level, Rate, Depth and Filter knobs really do a lot to shape the tone. You can do even more with the high and low cuts.\\n3) Stereo outs make for a really nice chorusing effect between amps.\\n4) The pedal design is very responsive to the foot when playing, jumping around, and stomping. Some of the plunger switches on other types of pedals can get stuck, break, or fail to engage/disengage when you step on them. The Boss switching is much smoother in my experience.\\n5) Tough. I jam with a guitar player who has used and abused his Boss DS-1 distortion pedal for over 15 years and it's still hanging in there. Meanwhile, I broke a $340 boutique chorus pedal plunger switch with a clumsy stomp one day. That simply would not happen with a Boss and that's why I replaced said boutique candy ass with this one (even though it was easy to fix the switch on the other one with some solder).\\n\\nLong story short, the Boss line is money well spent.\", \"I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick.

Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (haven't tried it yet).

At the time was a very good price', 'Before I begin, please know that I\\'ve been a musician for over 3 decades and along with playing, I\\'ve been doing my own setups, repairs, builds and refinishing for most of that time as well.  In other words, please be assured that I do in fact know a little something about guitars.\\n\\nGuitar strings are, much like guitars themselves, a very personal matter of choice...everyone has different tastes and preferences.  For myself and the music I play (classic rock, blues, oldies, etc), GHS Boomers are about the best strings out there for electrics.  In short, I\\'ve probably tried just about every brand of guitar string out there in the 30+ years I\\'ve been playing...Slinky\\'s, SIT, D\\'addarios, Gibson, Fender, Elixers...you name it, I\\'ve probably had them on a guitar at one point or another. The simple truth is that sooner or later, I have always come back to GHS Boomers for my electrics (I like Earthwoods on my acoustics and Rotosounds on my basses).\\n\\nTo me, there are 3 major factors to consider when choosing/purchasing guitar strings; tone, feel and longevity.  You can have a great sounding guitar string, but if it tarnishes and rusts out inside of a week (much like D\\'addario\\'s do), then they\\'re really just a waste of money.  Likewise, you can have strings that hold out for ages, but if they sound like crap (like Elixers and SIT\\'s...terrible strings), again, what\\'s the point?  And obviously, no one wants to use guitar strings that feel like barbed wire!  LOL!  So that said, as a person who currently owns over 20 guitars (at one time my collection was over 40), I go through -A LOT- of guitar strings...I KNOW guitar strings...and I\\'ve found Boomers to have the best over-all combination of those three factors - tone, feel and longevity.  The fact that their affordable, in my book at least, is just icing on the cake!\\n\\nTo give you a quick comparison, I would compare the tone and feel of these strings to the ever infamous Ernie Ball Slinky\\'s (which I use as my backups when I can\\'t get ahold of Boomers)...to my ears the sound is a bit brighter, but not by much and the feel is VERY comparable.  If you\\'ve used and like Slinky\\'s, I suspect you\\'ll be pleased with these as well.  The biggest difference is in the longevity...all things being equal and assuming I\\'m cleaning my strings and such after playing, I might get a month out of Slinky\\'s before they really need to be changed (when I\\'m playing regularly), where as I can often go 2 - 3 months between string changes with the Boomers.  No, they don\\'t maintain that \"new string sound\" for THAT long and for recording situations I\\'d go with new strings in any case, however for average playing...practices, gigs, etc., they do in fact hold up quite well.\\n\\nIn addition, I also have to say that I especially like these \"Thick & Thins\", 10-52 gauge (I think the Slinky equivalent is \"Heavy Bottoms\").  I play mostly Strats (again as far as my electrics go) and I find these give my Strats a bit fuller sound than standard 10\\'s.  They\\'re also fairly close to the same gauge I use on my acoustics so there\\'s not too much of a shock when I switch back and forth.\\nBTW...since we\\'re talkin\\' guitar strings here, a quick piece of wisdom - for those who may be moving to a heavier gauge (say from .009\\'s to .010\\'s), MAKE SURE you have your instrument setup by a qualified tech!  In my many years of playing, I\\'ve seen more guitars screwed up because people didn\\'t understand the importance of a good setup.  Changing string gauges on your instrument typically requires the nut be filed for the correct string width, along with truss rod and bridge adjustments, etc.  It\\'s well worth learning to do yourself, however if you\\'ve never done this sort of thing before (i.e. you\\'re new to guitars in general which is why you\\'re reading this review to begin with, LOL), it\\'s well worth finding a decent tech.\\n\\nSo with all of that, I have to give these a big ol\\' 5 out of 5 stars.  I\\'ve used Boomers for a good many years now...they are part of \"my sound\" and they have always come thru for me!  Ya really can\\'t ask for much more than that.', 'Best sounding strings ever', 'Got these on my Ibanez guitar, freaking LOVE them.

I mention it in the review but well over a year later I\\'m thrilled with it, and it\\'s about 35 bucks more. Well worth the investment for more reasons than I have time to get into right now. This Crybaby will do if you absolutely can\\'t stretch your budget. *\\n\\nHard item to review because there\\'s a lot of ways to look at this thing. In short, it\\'s a good and obviously usable wah with a classic sound, and at a great price. BUT, it\\'s a one-trick pony and has a few small drawbacks. There are (very slightly) better sounding and more functional wahs today in my opinion, though none at this price.\\n\\nFirst some wah history + my experience: wahs went into major production in the mid-60s, and so this design is a reflection of the infancy of wahs. To some, especially in the guitar community, the earliest designs of [whatever] were the best and there\\'s no changing their mind. My Dad\\'s a guy like that. Fair enough, I know I\\'m not swaying opinions that were formed 40+ years ago! But I got my Crybaby (from Dad) as a present in \\'88 or \\'89 and used it for 20+ years. Never even tried another, before recently. I had just always been accustomed to all of the little quirks of my Crybaby and accepted them.\\n\\nI don\\'t use the wah effect all that much and it stays off for probably 3 out of 4 songs; it\\'s a pretty essential effect when needed but easy to get carried away with. Most of the music I play falls somewhere in the range of heavy rock-heavy metal, but at home I\\'ll do a little classic rock or blues rock here and there. I\\'m not doing anything radically different with a wah, mostly just your typical Guns N\\' Roses, Alice in Chains, Jimi Hendrix type parts and the occasional solo. I don\\'t want a wah pedal to sound radically different.\\n\\nAnyway so that\\'s where I\\'m coming from. Now on my Crybaby, one day the pot crapped out again and I just decided it was time to explore other options, figuring I could always repair it or replace it with the same if I wanted. I\\'ve been through lots of guitars and amps, and many other pedals, but was generally okay with the Crybaby for my purposes. Not perfectly happy but content. So breaking down some specifics here:\\n\\nThe good:\\n\\n-Solid, heavy construction (bottom plate aside, that\\'s a little thin, but there are large rubber feet so it doesn\\'t matter)\\n-Mechanical\\n-Familiar, classic sound, can\\'t go wrong\\n-No learning curve\\n-Relatively low price\\n-You have the ability to turn it on and leave it cocked in a certain position for a certain sound. I don\\'t like the \"cocked wah\" sound personally, but some people do it on occasion. Many wahs do this but many like Morleys don\\'t, those rest in the fully back position\\n\\nThe so-so or bad:\\n\\n-It activates by pushing all the way forward in the treble position and making a hard click, which can be audible to the audience. There are better designed wahs, where it turns on and off just by putting your foot on or off the pedal.\\n-Requires somewhat uncommon adapter so doesn\\'t work with most daisy-chain power cables people are using today\\n-The original potentiometer was sketchy for me, but that happens with time\\n-A little hard to clean. Not normally a consideration but dust can be problematic given design\\n-The bottom plate is a little thin, odd compared to solid feel of the rest of pedal. Doesn\\'t really matter but worth noting.\\n-There\\'s zero adjustability\\n-Not true bypass. I think too much tends to be made about true bypass these days and there are worse offenders.\\n-No alternate features at all, it doesn\\'t double as a volume pedal, you can\\'t change the sweep range or anything like that.\\n-I had occasional issues with interference including even random radio signals!\\n\\n-To me personally, the sweep range is too wide, as in too bassy on one end, and waaay too trebly and harsh when full forward. The \"sweet spot\" you really want is smaller than I\\'d like. And again, you can\\'t adjust anything. Now some people like this sweep range as is, and once you get used to the pedal you\\'ll get a feel for where your preferred range is and your foot will \"learn\" where to go.\\n-In practice, I found a little compression helps to balance out the pedal. It feels somewhat louder when in the treble position versus the bass positions, making some notes a little more lost in the mix while others cut right through. Some other wahs seem a little smoother in this regard. And again, this is something other people may like.\\n\\nI think $70 is a great price for this and reflects its current place among wahs, minor flaws and nonexistent feature set. Solid choice for beginners and intermediate players on a budget, and served me well enough for years. It\\'s the classic wah sound and once you find that sweet spot and get the feel for it, it sounds good. However I think other wahs not only sound better but offer more, albeit at a greater cost.\\n\\nAlternatives: I tried 10-12 total between a few NJ shops so really only a handful in the grand scheme. But I was especially impressed with the Cantrell wah, the Tremonti Wah, Weeping Demon, and Fulltone Clyde Deluxe. I eventually wound up with the Morley Vai 2 wah which isn\\'t a very classic design, but sounds the best. Plus it had some adjustability to fine tune it to my own preferences. For me it\\'s just the great wah sound but with a more modern and functional design...I was able to adjust it, no more CLICK to activate, and you can even adjust activation time from instant to more than 3 seconds (though instant-on is the only way to go for me).\\n\\nBut to be clear this Crybaby is still a good pedal if you\\'re just looking for a wah, and probably the perfect choice if you\\'re gift shopping for someone\\'s first. It\\'s still at least 90% as good as anything else as far as sound and I wouldn\\'t suggest an upgrade to someone with a (working) Crybaby already - unless they\\'re very particular. If this were the only wah in the world I wouldn\\'t have a problem using it forever. Nobody in the audience would hear a real difference between this and most any other wah effect anyway.\\n\\nStill...if you\\'re a somewhat serious or working guitarist and need a wah I\\'d explore some of the newer options for sure, even if they\\'re other Crybabys. You can\\'t go wrong with this one but you can do better.', \"It's a cry baby, what else should I say! Gives you the sound you want and with a little adjust to suit your fancy...\", 'You will always hear from a multitude of musicians about their personal preference in guitars,\\namps, stomp boxes, pickups, effects, and even picks. Well, that goes for strings as well. The\\none relatively inexpensive thing you can do for yourself is to try different sizes and types of\\nstrings.\\n\\nListen, who cares what Jimi or Jimmy used. Seek out and develop your own tone. Strings can\\nhelp you do that. When it comes to the vintage sound there is pure nickel. Companies, in the\\n50s, experimented with different metals but pure nickel was found to be the most pleasing,\\nbalanced tone, and easy on the frets too. In those early years electric players wanted less\\ndistortion also. Pure nickel produced less distortion as well.\\n\\nWell, things shifted from Nickel to steel strings. Two ideas were that either economics was the\\nreason nickel was no longer wanted or the tonal shifts of the 1960s. A compromise was brought\\nabout and nickel plated steel strings were born.\\n\\nThese GHS Boomers are most likely going to give you some warmth from the nickel plating along\\nwith a clean tone. If that is what you want. They can also be hotter dependent upon their blend\\nof nickel to steel. These Boomers don\\'t bend as easily as pure nickel but that is what you would\\nexpect with a steel center. Also, nickel plated steel strings appear to not sustain as well as pure\\nnickel.\\n\\nI have tried both pure nickel and nickel plated. Indeed the pure nickel (all things being equal) are\\nmore mellow, easier to bend and tend to give you a \"vintage\" tone. The Boomers tend to provide\\nmore of an edge. They will sound hotter and brighter on your electric. That can be fun, so much\\nfun, especially with a nice pair of P-90s on your guitar.\\n\\nIf you use, or plan on using, a lot of tone-sucking effects pedals, going with the brighter, hotter,\\nstring like these GHS Boomers would be a good choice. Again, if that is what you are looking for in\\na sound. Search any guitar forum and up will rise from the thread-graveyard a ton of threads on\\nstrings and how they can affect tone. Or not. Lots of opinionated musicians on guitar forums. This\\nis why some people buy multiple guitars. A guitar for every season, so to speak, with nickel plated\\nsteel on one and pure nickel on another.\\n\\nI have used these strings on a solid body Gibson Les Paul guitar and on a semi-hollowbody Fender\\nTelecaster guitar. Slightly different sounds. Again, think about the wood, or lack of it, on the guitar.\\nThat is where some of the resonance comes from, along with the type of pickup, height of those\\npickups and, of course, your playing style. Most serious musicians know that Jimi\\'s, Jimmy\\'s, and\\neven Eddie or Slashes tone is in their fingers.\\n\\nI like these strings and give them 5 stars because they are well made, sound good. I also like the\\nin between gauge. They don\\'t bend as well as pure nickel of the same gauge, but I knew that going\\nin, so no stars off for that. GHS is a good company and stand by their product. The Boomers come\\nin 8s (Ultra Light) all the way to 13s (Heavy). So take your pick, try some of these strings and\\nmake some hot music tonight.', 'These strings really have a great sound, and they lasted me a long time.  I think they compare favorably to Ernie Balls at a much better price!', \"These strings are the second best set of strings on the market.

The trick is to find a pair in weights that match your application.\\n\\nBasic characteristics are heavy with a defined chick, but not nearly as defined as the Mastersound series, and excellent ride qualities, especially when used with a loose clutch and partially open.  Most of these pairs are too heavy for lighter jazz, but there are exceptions if you have an idea of the weight. They are typically in the 1200 top and 1550 bottom range (in grams). Those weights work for most loud, heavily amplified music.\\n\\nIf you sift through a number of pairs, though, you will find music lighter ones. That is because there is a lot of variation in Zildjian's manufacturing process. If you  are playing lightly amplified music, like some forms of progressive rock and more traditional blues, then an 1100 gram top and a bottom in the 1450 range will work well. Of course, even lighter is better. For louder jazz with horns and some amplification 1050 gram tops and 1375-1400 gram bottoms should work. For acoustic music I would look at the K Custom or K Constantinople lines for appropriate hats.\\n\\nMy advice usually means purchasing them in a brick and mortar store or from an online source that can provide the weights of a specific pair. Only boutique sellers offer this service.  However, if you are playing loud(er) music then an off-the-shelf pair is probably sufficient. These are, after all, one of the standards among drummers and have been ever since Louis Bellson collaborated with Zildjain in the early 60s to develop this model.\", 'These were recommended by everyone I asked (about getting \"sizzle\").\\n\\nThe bottom is much heavier than the top and that how it works, the top sizzles against the bottom.\\n\\nPerfect for reggae & dub (and probably loads of other genres too).\\n\\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!', 'Really like the short leg, not too big for my banjo.', 'This is a great capo for the ukulele.

However, the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product. That is to say, the rubber feet began to come off in no time. If you mount it on a pedal board, you will probably remove those feet and this won't be a problem. Also, the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal. If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable, at least on my unit, the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. Those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat. What I have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push ALL THE WAY in, otherwaise, ZAP. Other than those two issues, the power issue really no fault of Dunlop's if you use the supplied power cable, its been a great pedal.

I highly recommend this petal.  it's price is attractive as well.\", \"I tried a bunch of wah wahs (Morley, Vox, etc.) including the top Dunlop model and they were real noisy and didn't like my pedalboard at all in series.

I find it difficut to turn it on and off. It isn't any different than the others I've tried, but you really have to step on it hard to click it most times. Maybe theres a way to adjust the switch pressure under the expression pedal. I guess they felt like most people will be turning it on and off while they are using it. Cheers Abz\", '\"Oh its a crybaby\", \"I have a crybaby wah\", \"You suck because you don\\'t own a crybaby\"...I\\'m tired of hearing these statements from guitarists that are so fresh they couldn\\'t even tell you how many strings their instrument has!  This wah pedal just doesn\\'t cut it.  Maybe at one time, but not today, it hasn\\'t been up to par in a LONG time.  As a young player I insisted on having a wah pedal.  My mom bought me this one.  I thought it was awesome until I learned better.  It took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when I finally did I thought I broke it!\\n\\nThe eq on this pedal isn\\'t good, there is no smooth transition from heel to toe.  There is a big drop in the freq. that kills the effect.  You have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop.  You have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off.  Very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board.  I can\\'t say its just a complete piece of junk, it does give you a wah effect, it is a classic pedal but THERE IS BETTER out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing?  I even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue, I still had to slam on it to turn it on/off and it still sounded like a cheap wah.\\n\\nMy suggestion?  The Mark Tremonti wah is great!  Kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use!  It may cost more, but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway, so just go with the Tremonti Power Wah to begin with.  What I use for wah is the Digitech RP250 processor.  You may say that this is a cheap processor, and it is, but I\\'ve been using it for years and I haven\\'t seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters.  Why I suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity, how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on (I have mine set fairly light) and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily.  You even have presets (crybaby being one of them)  You can get an entire processor full of effects AND an awesome wah for a little bit more.\\n\\nIf you want a cheap child\\'s gimic-type toy, this is for you.  Want to get serious about a wah?  Spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere.', \"Ok,I got this used in a trade. I was looking for one of these because I have had these pickups before in another Epiphone and loved them,the 700t. I had no idea though how nice this guitar was. I can't any reason not to love it. It has an in your face tone,cuts right through the distortion,if you use distortion. I use very heavy distortion and these pups have a very blighting tone,I would compare it to the 498t that you find in the Gibsons. It's a bolt on neck but that doesn't concern me,they did I nice job building this,it's a perfect fit in the neck pocket on the body. The neck itself is very comfortable,The guitar itself is very heavy like a Gibson and the pickups are much much better than the classic alnico pups that come in most Epiphone guitars. I've been playing for most of my life,I know guitars and I currently own 10 guitars.

Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.\\n\\nIt's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman, and I really like that the neck is smaller. It's also fairly lightweight.\\n\\nOverall, I'm happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe.

He had a deep emotional attatchment to it because of the person who gave it to him, and we couldn't really ask him to get rid of it.

I really can't find any negative about it. It's just a perfect standard wah. You won't regret this purchase at all. Just put a good analog fuzz after it & you're good to go.\", 'When you buy a product that is used by the most professionals, with legendary musicians standing by it, you would expect a product that is without equal. With the Original CryBaby, Dunlop has somehow managed (using testimonials from the pros) to sucker countless people, myself included, into thinking this is the Wah to get.\\n\\nProblems include the following:\\n\\nAlmost no low-end wah. Playing from a large, loud Marshall stack, if I play anything on the E6 or A5 strings and try to augment with wah you can\\'t hardly hear any change. Granted I use very heavy distortion, but with high-end Seymour humbuckers and a Marshall stack, the sound is clean and distinguishable when not using the wah, and nearly the same when using it. For low-end I have noticed an interesting effect that IS possible though; activating the wah and then dropping it back to almost the back of the pedal and leaving it like that can make an interesting sound that would be comparable in comparison to talking normally and talking with your mouth nearly completely covered.\\n\\nThe other problem, which is actually present in MOST wahs (except one I\\'ll mention in a second) is button activation. First of all, having to push the pedal UP to click it on makes it so you can\\'t effectively start with a closed wah sound, only full open wah. Second, having to adjust the pedal just to get it to the point where it is activated uses precious milliseconds of deliberate action that could be spent focusing on that new lick you haven\\'t perfected, or nailing every note in that solo you\\'re performing.\\n\\nWhen I want wah I want it now. And when I want it I want to open into wah, not have it already open when the button is pressed. And when I\\'m done with wah I want it off. These problems have been solved by Morley with the Bad Horsie and Bad Horsie 2 Vai Wahs. They have no button so all you do is start pushing the pedal and it auto starts the wah-wah effect. When you are done with the wah, step off the pedal and it will deactivate in less than a second and go back to normal. Also, it\\'s on a spring which may not be ideal for some, but it will reset the pedal to the down (back) position when your foot comes off. The good thing with this is you only have to push with your toes, essentially just stepping on it, and then lightening you step to bring it back instead of adjusting pressure to the heal and pushing it back down.\\n\\nAll that being said, it does work and it does create a wah-wah effect (though only effective through a clean amp or in lead sequences) so you do get what was advertised and at a decent price (the Bad Horsie is around 3 times as much).\\n\\nAdditional Info: Mine was purchased through Amazon from Dunlop and yet still did not come with a power adapter. Battery life is very, very short. And leaving a cable plugged into the \"Input\" (from the guitar) WILL run the battery down, even if the cable isn\\'t plugged into anything on the other end. It makes no sense and can cost money.', \"It is a good pedal, but it just doesn't have the sound I was looking for. It is great for playing funk music, but for us metal heads, the wah is just too weak. For metal artists, I would recommend looking elsewhere. I am going to look into getting an Ibanez Weeping Demon, or a Morley, or whatever it is Behringer is limping to the barn with these days.\", 'MY experience with crybaby is it has a great tone.  More overbearing than the Vox or cleaner wahs.

But I am not sure that I am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance!  I kinda think I am.  The VOX and BBE seem to have a brighter sound which is less \"wah-ed\" if you will.

A Time Trip.', 'For years, if you wanted to play the electric bass that Paul played in The Beatles, you had to fork over around $2,000.00 for a Hofner bass. Yes, they are made a lot better today than when Paul bought his first one for about $175.00 in 1961. But most folks can\\'t afford that. A cost effective alternative in the same style has always been the Epiphone Viola bass.\\n\\nFor about a quarter of the cost of a new Hofner 500-1, you can have the look and  sound close to that of the original, with some differences and caveats. The Hofner is a hollow body bass, which means that there is an open space inside the body of the guitar. This is one of the main contributors to it\\'s original sound, which is more subdued, and mellow than more modern solid body basses, which have no chamber.\\n\\nThe Viola is also of the hollow body design. Though the electronics on the Viola are radically different from a Hofner, with the two humbucking pickups, a set of tape wrapped Hofner style strings, and amp modeling, you are right there back in Liverpool\\'s Cavern Club.\\n\\nI bought my Viola several years ago and am delighted with it\\'s vintage styling and classic British Invasion sound. For those who are interested in it\\'s stats:\\n\\n* Top: Laminated flame maple\\n* Neck: Maple, set\\n* Chrome hardware\\n* 30.5\" short scale\\n* 2 pickups: NYR & NYT mini humbuckers\\n* Nut width: 1.65\"\\n* Fingerboard: Rosewood\\n* Inlay: Dots\\n* Finish: Vintage sunburst\\n\\nMy Viola bass was manufactured in Korea and is flawless in construction, fit and finish. In 2003, Epiphone, opened a factory in China to keep up with world demand.\\n\\nRecently, Hofner has released two new lines of their Hofner Beatle bass. The Hofner Icon bass is a close approximation of the original, even though many have compared it more to the Viola bass. It sells for around $400.00.\\n\\nThe Hofner Contemporary bass is a close ( though not exact) replica of their main line of Beatle bass. It is a beautiful bass guitar and sells for around $800.00.\\n\\nThat still may be a little high for those who want the look and sound but can\\'t afford a Hofner. I can highly recommend the Epiphone Viola Bass as a good sounding and easy playing alternative to the original!', 'My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It\\'s a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It\\'s still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal \"open\" to achieve a certain warm sound. That\\'s when I went looking at the cry baby.\\nAt the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix, Classic, and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don\\'t even touch my Morley anymore. It\\'s cry baby all the way', \"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on, which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch, so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle, and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah, but in my experience, the sound is equivalent on the base models.\", 'My son is in 7th heaven with these sticks.

I hadn\\'t paid attention that these sticks weren\\'t \"NYLON\" tipped, so the quality of the sticks was my mistake. these sticks, would be what I would recommend for beginners or what you\\'d have at a music store for demo-ing drum sets.', 'This pedal was exactly what I was looking for. My only complaint, if you can call it a complaint, is that it does not come with a power source. I think it should. Other than that petty item, it is fantastic. Thank you.', \"First some background, I'm kinda a pedal nut.  I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals, many of them some kind of distortion, fuzz, OD, etc.  Its a hobby, addiction, whatever you wanna call it, I've owned way too many of these things.\\n\\nOne of my least favorite pedals was the Boss DS-1.  Sure, it was inexpensive and extremely durable, but it sounded lousy.  It was a noisy, brittle, fake sounding tone, and I didn't find a likeable sound no matter the settings or what guitar or amp I was running it through.  Long story short I had it modded into a particular Marshall overdrive circuit and its now fantastic as it sounds nothing like the stock models.\\n\\nSo imagine my surprise when I get a used DS-2 for a steal on ebay and its actually a good pedal!  This pedal does what the DS-1 was SUPPOSED to do but failed at:  Its a good, general purpose distortion.  Its not a super saturated sound, but its a likable tone that's far more full than the DS-1 ever got.  Also unlike the DS-1, it sounds great on every amp I've tried it on (one of which seems to hate boss pedals, so I was very impressed by that).\\n\\nIts not a metal distortion, but for classic rock crunch, this pedal does just fine.  I actually stacked it up against my script era MXR Distortion + and I was able to dial in a tone that sounded very similar, if just a touch less transparent.\\n\\nAll in all, a great, versatile little pedal that does exactly what its supposed to do.  If you're thinking of buying a DS-1, skip it, this thing is worth the little bit of extra cash, it is easily ten times the pedal.\\n\\nPOST SCRIPT EDIT (3-16-12):  I won ANOTHER DS-2 off ebay for a ridiculous steal again, this time one made in Japan.  GOOD NIGHT!  The Japanese ones are amazing!  Its like having a Marshall stack on the floor!  I mean these new ones are good pedals (esp compared to the new DS-1s) but the Japanese ones are flat out amazing.  I can only assume the Japanese DS-1s are similarly impressive, and if so, I can finally understand how that pedal ever got the reputation it for some reason still carries.  Grab a Japanese one if you can (and prepare to have your face melted!), if not, the new ones are still a fine pedal.\", \"This pop filter does its job well. It attaches to pretty much any stand I've used it on!\", \"Arrived in timely manner. I bought it because of the shape of the tips to maintain more of a consistent sound despite slight fluctuations in the angles when doing rolls but the finishing touches weren't as on par as other brands, such as the lacquer finish on one of the tips had a small glob that needed to be scrapped off or else it looked and felt like a deformed tip, plus a few inches below each tip the neck-shaft had a rough splintery finish which I sanded down with fine sandpaper to avoid splinters, and there was slightly more noticeable warpage than other brands but otherwise still useable.\", \"ProMark is the standard for drum sticks. I have changed from 5B's to 7A's over the years and these have given me better stick control. 747's are great too.\", 'This stick is incredibly well balanced, especially for folks like myself who play traditional grip. The taper is the key to the way this stick performs. Regardless of grip, if you use the Moeller technique this stick\\'s taper will aid in getting that whip motion going.\\n\\nI love the finish too. It\\'s smooth, but not slippery on those hot gigs where you wind up sweating. And the tips on these do not seem to chip like other brands. I have tried a few other well known and respected brands and found that the tips rapidly chipped or wore away (and I am a light player.)\\n\\nYou can tell that these sticks were made with good quality control because you can roll them on a flat surface and they are always straight.

This stick, though, is the same .512\" diameter and 15 3/8\" long. It\\'s great for switching to a darker cymbal pattern that the wood tips allow, and the shorter length is excellent for moderate tempo playing.', 'I recently just went back to using BOSS pedals after a long usage of many so called \"BOUTIQUE) pedals. I decided to simplify my pedalboard, and my life, and get this pedalboard, and a few select BOSS pedals to use. I like this alot, because it lets me keep all the pedals I use in one convienient location, and its a grab and go setup. Speaking of set up, you can leave your pedals in the case, and when you are ready to use them, just plug in the adapter into some power, and your ready to go. It sure has simplified my life, and has gotten unwanted clutter(pedals) off my floor, thus eliminating a mess. The only thing I would change on this pedalboard, is the sliding plastic latches on it. They are a little to flimsy for my taste, but oh well. Looks like BOSS could at least redesign the latches. Anyway, all in all, if you are looking for a grab and go pedalbard, and only use 6-7 pedals, give this a try....', 'Love it', 'I first got this pop filter for my Blue Snowball microphone and it fits perfectly.

I think Gibson has crazy prices and exploits players with price tags too high. Maybe they will sell more if they cut prices in half or more, until then, Epiphone is just as good in my book anyway. Take it from an old sea bass who has played 45 years and owned just about every top brand guitar out there. .', 'I OWN 8 GUITARS,ALL BUT ONE TELECASTER,ARE EPIPHONES,I HAVE ANOTHER DOT IN THE NATURIAL FINISH,IT IS VERY PRETTY,BUT THIS DOT CHERRY FINISH IS BUETIFUL,AND PLAYS LIKE A DREAM,IF I WASENT GUITAR POOR,I WOUL;D ORDER ANOTHER ONE.', \"To start, I've been playing bass for about 5 or 6 years. I've played Thunderbirds at Guitar Centers before and I've always loved their look and sound, so I decided to buy one for myself. Overall, I love it but it has some drawbacks.\\n\\nPros: -It's a beautiful looking instrument. The vintage sunburst on the body looks great and so does the distinctive Thunderbird logo. The 'reverse' body gives it a radical, eye-catching look.\\n\\n-It has a great, deep, rumbling tone. The bottom end is nice and clean and the higher end sounds pretty great too. Out of all the basses I own, I love the sound of this one the most. Its a great sound for rock or metal.\\n\\nCons: -Thunderbirds are notorious for their weight and tendency for neck-dive, and this one is no different. It's fairly weighty, although not as heavy as some other basses I own like my Schecter Stilletto 5. If you're used to playing basses on the heavier end it shouldn't be an issue. The neck will sometimes dive if you take your hands off the instrument with the neck at a low angle, but if you keep the neck at a high angle before you let go, it usually won't dive on its own. If you play it sitting down, it feels pretty comfortable, but for some reason something about the design of the body always makes my right leg fall asleep.\\n\\n-THE WORST ISSUE: perhaps in response to complains about neck dive in earlier Thunderbird models, Epiphone have moved the location of one of the strap attachment points. Instead of being positioned on the side of the body above the neck (as it is in most guitars/basses and as it is in the picture) it is now located on the back of the instrument where the neck bolts on to the body.\\n\\nWhile this has largely corrected the neck dive issue, the problem is that for whatever reason Epiphone decided to make one of the neck bolts extra long and make the strap attachment nub a part of this bolt. After playing it a few hours a day for about 3 or 4 days, this neck bolt ripped right out of the body (fortunately I caught the Thunderbird before it hit the floor). The weight of the bass had caused the bolt to strip it's threads inside the body and slip right out, taking the strap with it.\\n\\nBesides this glaring issue, I love this bass and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a deep, growling tone for rock or metal.\\n\\nEDIT: I called Epiphone and they had me send in the bass to be repaired. They moved the strap button to where it is on the picture (above the neck) and repaired the stripped bolt. And...now the neck dives like no tomorrow. Seriously, if you play this bass standing up you can't take your fretting hand off of the neck at all or else it will dive straight for the floor. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\\n\\nThat said, I've had this bass for eight months now and I'm still madly in love with it. It can handle anything I throw at it and it looks as beautiful and eye-catching as ever.\", 'My original bass had a humbucker and boy have I missed that tone.  All the Jazz, precision and P/J bass\\' I\\'ve played just haven\\'t filled that void.  I play mostly classic rock and blues covers which is where this bass excels.  It has amazing tone and growl to die for.  I bought mine used and it was set up and ready to go by the time it got to me (just needed a new set of strings).  With a set of DiAddario semi flats and a KB200 amp I got a tone I\\'m not going to try to replace for a long time.  It wasn\\'t a purchase I rushed into I tried other Epiphones (EB series [what can say I say, I\\'m attracted to the Humbucker]), Squire\\'s, Ibanez (gsr, sr), ESP, and even a Danelectro.  None, NONE of those came close to the tone I got from the Thunderbird (of course I may be bias as it does play into the genre I prefer).  Any Bass that had a better sound was easily twice the price ($600+).  The body is killer, and as far as I can tell indestructible (You can search reviews online and find testimony to this).  Watch out for the neck dive though, I didn\\'t think it would bother me at first, but after holding through practice for a couple hours it gets tiring. The neck is pretty chunky, it\\'s not what I would call \"fast\". 4 stars is appropriate for this bass, It\\'s good but needs a few modifications to be great.', \"I didn't buy mine on amazon.com, however I am going to buy it's case. I was walking in a pawn shop one day minding my own business this bass spoke to me. I picked it up and I really liked it. It's really long and uniquely weighted. It has great clean tones and with separate vol pods you can kinda push that growl I like so much.\", 'I acquired an Epiphone Thunderbird IV at a local guitar place.  It came with a hardshell case and all for $249, which was a great price for what I got.\\n\\nAnd what I got was a great bass, which had a good tonal range but always sounded warm and never... piercing.  Sometimes, when a person is looking for a punchy bass sound they end up sounding piercing.  I never had any fret buzz or problems with the hardware.  This guitar looks very close to its Gibson counterpart, though they differ, mainly in the fact that the Epiphone has a bolt-on neck.\\n\\nDespite having the widely considered inferior bolt-on, this bass has some great sustain.  In fact, my only complaints about the insturment were that it was awkward to play while sitting down.  It wasn\\'t THAT bad, for those of you who\\'ve played a \"V\" sitting down, but it did take getting used to.  My only \"real\" complaint then is, as another reviewer stated, the guitar is head-heavy and will tip down a bit if you let go of the neck momentarily.  Once my neck swung down and smaked the floor!  But its built tough, and there wasn\\'t a ding or a nick.', 'Works For me!', 'Still too large for my finger.', 'Pretty thin and jangly.

I picked up a cheap Fender Starcaster beginner package, and I liked it, but wanted something with more resonance.  I was put on to the DOT by a friend who works at a chain music store, but I bought it through Amazon.\\n\\nIt came quickly and well packages, and in great shape out of the box.  I didn't adjust the setup, I just tuned the factory strings and started playing.  It feels like a high quality instrument from head to tail, so much so that I doubt the anti-China bias that you find when discussing guitars.  I've had it for just over a month, and I've played it pretty much every day.  I put some flat wounds on it and it hums.  I don't even know why I'm writing this when I could be over there playing it.\\n\\nIn fact, that's what I'm going to go do.\", 'This guitar (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Epiphone-Dot-Archtop-Electric-Guitar-Cherry/dp/B0002CZUIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Epiphone Dot Archtop Electric Guitar, Cherry</a>) is amazing value for money.  Mine was shipped in a cheap cardboard box within box but somehow managed to survive the ordeal of shipping without incurring any damage (in spite of a big hole on the outer carton).  The Amazon product picture does not do the guitar any justice.  Amazon really should update it.  The guitar \"in person\" looks drop-dead gorgeous - with a glossy deep cherry finish that still allows you to see the wood grain through it.  The Amazon picture just looks flat in comparison.\\n\\nThe fit and finish on my guitar was absolutely flawless, as good as my multi-thousand dollar guitars!  The double cream binding on the body looks great.  The frets could probably do with a little bit of polishing/reshaping or I may just simply play the guitar until they wear in a little bit.  This is common for guitars that come from the factory.  Speaking of the factory, mine is made in Indonesia and the guitar comes with a \"set up in the USA\" label and checklist that is hand-checked and signed.  One thing you must do when you get the guitar brand new is to tighten the truss rod as it will have been loosened for shipping.  Mine was completely loose when it arrived and there was a very slight bow in the neck as a result that was easily fixed by tightening the rod until it was no longer completely loose but not too tight either.  I also lowered the bridge slightly from the factory setting.\\n\\nWithout plugging it in, the guitar sounds lovely - that\\'s why I love semi-acoustics!  The natural sustain is very, very impressive.  I\\'d say this guitar sustains better than my Fender Stratocaster.  The stock pickups sound very good to me.  My other guitars are all equipped with single-coil pickups so I love the contrast the Epiphone Dot\\'s stock pickups give me.  You can eaily get a great sustaining blues or jazz sound.  It can even do some nice jangly sounds on the bridge pickup if I play with the EQ on my amp.  I\\'m sure if I upgraded the pickups to the Gibson \\'57 ones the guitar would sound even better, but frankly, I\\'m totally happy with it stock.\\n\\nOverall I\\'m really pleased that I got this.  It\\'s the lowest cost guitar I own but it holds its own against the rest of my collection.  I\\'ve been wanting a ES-355 style guitar for some time now and I\\'m delighted with what I got.

Great little thing but a bit smaller than the original corricidian bottles. ENJOY!\", 'too cumbersome for me', \"I purchased a blues bottle slide awhile ago.  Loaned it out to a friend of mine..never saw it again.  I guess that means he liked it ha!  Well, I liked it so much that I just let him have it and decided I'd just buy another one for me.  It works absolutely fantastic, I love the sound of a blues bottle slide on my guitar AND it's not very expensive to get which makes my wallet feel pretty good too.\", 'oK I always wanted a ES 335 Gibson which this Epiphone is a copy of. I play professionally for most of my life at age 53  saw this guitar for this price and wondered how good can this copy be. My main guitar is a 78 Les Paul deluxe, top of the line Gibson gold plated the works. Had it since I was 18 and there is nothing like it in any way. I went to Gibson factory last year in Nashville and tried all Les Pauls below the deluxe level they were nice but not as smooth at any level untill you get the top of the line Les Paul. In fact I found the basic to mid range Gibsons no better quailty then this Epiphone. The difference really comes in the top level models.\\n That all said this Epiphone is not the same at the Gibson 2,500.00 ES 335. What I did discover is that the fit and finish is very very good with a few minor blemishes\\n( very minor you have to look close for)that Gibson would never pass. But I am comparing a Lincoln to a Ford here. They both will drive you in comfort, but the Lincoln( Gibson) does it perfectly on a smoother easier ride. But I have to say the Epiphone is a top of the line Ford for comparision sake. The neck is nice, smooth and not to bulky as I found on some of the Low priced Gibsons, sound is very nice, the finish is suprisingly nice for a 350 guitar. The defects are really minor to mention but I had to mention them because Gibsons are a perfect animal in the top price range. I would say this guitar could sell for twice the price. But due to LOW Chinese labor plus a well made Computer program cutting these crafted Guitars to be as close to perfect every time, time after time at a amazing price. The guitars are setup here in America.\\n When I opened the box up its a very nice guitar no problems, stays in tune as well. I dropped the action down to a lower lever because thats how my Paul is and though I cant get it to feel like the Les Paul action, its a close second. I adjusted the intonaton . All tuned in perfectly and I am very very pleased as anyone will be. For me I got as close as a ES 335 for a tenth of the cost of owning one. So if your a pro player or just starting out as others have said you cant beat this price and the quailty, sound and feel. I ordered mine and it bounced from the west coast to my home in Pa and its just as nice as the one I played at a local store. I ordered in on line, no tax free shipping at a lower price then the local guitar store..... so I took the chance, turned out it was fine.\\nOhh mine is a maple natural finish not Cherry but I saw all the finishes and they were as nice in all colors.\\nChinese low labor costs and computer robots making as close to perfect guitars are what your getting. Things even low priced form Asia these days can be made well in these times we live in. This guitar is a great example. Computers replacing hand craftsman. Sad but this is where things have gone, maybe for the better, maybe not. I may look at Epiphone more seriously for now on. Buy it you will be glad ya did.', 'I bought this because I can afford the Gibson version and I am impressed.

I had to drill one of my guitars to enlarge the hole, easy. The finish of the lock was O.K. the black suffered the most with some dings and scratches, depending on the shipping and how long the locks were packed the finishing flaws will vary. I noticed it the most on black.\\n\\nThey feel secure and lock well in place; I still feel they are a bit far from the guitar body as compared to the Schallers. I would recommend the dual design as opposed to the original.\\n\\nOne big negative is the strap installment; your life could turn into hell depending on the strap ends thickness. And the lock is just not designed to be removed form the strap easily. If you wish to change, wash or replace the strap in the future it is very hard and you could damage the locking mechanism (a metal ring, open locking C washer).\\n\\nSecond the Schaller: (chrome/nickel)\\nInstallation was simple also, straight on.

First of all, I did research on new guitar options at the local Guitar Center website and settled on this instrument. They had it for $199, so for kicks I looked on Amazon two nights before I had planned to test and buy at our GC on a Sat. Amazon had it for $159 and $199 for lots of extras. I already had a case and nice Marshall Amp, so only needed the guitar. The best part, it arrived on Sat about the same time I would have purchased locally. The reviews were so good, I was not worried about testing live before purchase and it was a great choice.\\n\\nI\\'m only 3 months into this journey to become a musician, so a beginner, but absolutely love everything about this guitar. I messed around in the early 90\\'s on old electric while in college, but never learned chords or any songs. When my wife acquired her old Sears-quality kids guitar from her Mom, I put new strings for something to mess around with on the weekends. Several weeks later, I got a cheap First Act electric for $25. Several weeks later a nice Takamine acoustic as the ears \"learned\" the notes and chords better. While switching from this quality acoustic guitar to the First Act, it was clearly apparent the First Act was a piece of junk. Notes and chords were just not clear and just not enjoyable to play. Well, this Epiphone is an awesome step forward combined with the Marshall amp. While I want to progress to blues scales in time, I\\'ve purposely focused on the major and minor chords and seamless transition between them. This guitar expresses the notes of chords so clearly. What I love most is the ability to slightly modify major chords like from Dmaj to Dsus4 and have it translate so clear as an example. Prior I never used the effects on my Marshall because it just sounded like a mess, but this guitar solves that issue. After a whole weekend of use, it felt like a big leap forward just because of quality. The fretboard layout helped refine the chords I\\'ve learned so far, so all strings were clear. Really helped practicing bending, hammer-ons and pull offs too. At any rate, for the money, it\\'s hard to beat. I suspect that if this journey continues a more expensive guitar may be warranted in a few years, but as others have said, this will always be a quality practice instrument. Especially considering we spend every other weekend at our beach bungalow and it is nice not having to transport every time.\\n\\nOh, it was good to go right out of the box except a slight tightening of the strings to get in tune.

It came setup just fine, with manual, an alin wrench for the kneck, which I checked, and needed no adjustment. There were only a couple of legitimate complaints about the guitar, the rest were people who ordered the package deal and had problems with the crappy amp. One: A user received his paint chipped, body blemishes, etc. Weird, obvious anomaly. Two: A user plugged into the amp with another guitar and it worked, so the problem lied with the electronics in the git.\\nThis is a great take on the classic Les Paul is excellent for multiple applications, especially METAL, which isn\\'t my main genre but I do play metal riffs occasionally, especially now on this guitar among my 12 other guitars.\\nWhat a deal.\\nWhen it comes to major guitar makers who make their own budget guitar, i.e. Fender Squier, etc. Epiphone is by far an exception.

Aquila's have a more organic feel and a fuller, richer sound. The Martins begin to hold their tune sooner - Aquila's take a couple of days or more - but the sound is thinner and the feel isn't nearly as friendly. The approximately 3 dollar price difference is not, for me, worth the lesser satisfaction, even on my least expensive ukes. Considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings, the higher-priced Aquila's still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks.

I cannot imagine putting any other strings on them. However, so far I have only tried Aquilas, these Martins, and whatever factory/stock strings strung on my ukuleles.\\n\\nNow my novel of a review begins. It is a story filled with discovery, love, bad decisions, regret, hope, reunion, a happy ending, and opens up for the unknown future. I hope you read it all, because I kind of have gone from a total ukulele noob to kind of a more knowledgeable and experience player, and I hope that my review will give you some insight into your own preference of strings.\\n\\nMy first ukulele was a cheap Makala MK-P. It was $47 from Austin Bazaar fulfilled by Amazon. I knew that factory strings on this uke was terrible, and ordered a separate set of strings with it. From what I\\'ve researched online, people everywhere rave about the Aquila strings. However, being a cheapo, I got this Martin M600s because it is almost half the price of a set of Aquila. Since the order was over $25, the Martins qualified as an \"add-on\" item.\\n\\nI loved my Makala - it played perfect, and with the M600 strings it had a wonderfully sweet, bright, and clear sound, despite being all laminate.\\n\\nFast forward 1 months - I now own 3 more ukes: Kala ASLAS (Solid lacewood with solid spruce top), Kala GACT (golden acacia concert travel/thinline), Pono MS (mahogany soprano). With two more on the way: Kala Solid Acacia Tenor, Islander Acacia Tenor. I bought all these from HMS - the Kalas all came with Aquila strings and HMS offers an extra set at discounted price that I usually get. So I have a bunch of Aquila strings.\\n\\nThe above paragraph basically leads to - now all my ukuleles are strung with Aquilas, as most every online sources I have researched praised Aquilas as \"the strings to have\", and you don\\'t really see much said about these Martin strings. (Aquila and Worth seem to be what everyone talks about on UU and other sites). I have discarded my Martin strings, and got rid of my first ukulele, the Makala Pineapple, as I had better ukes, and thought I had better strings.\\n\\nHowever, I felt like my ukuleles weren\\'t playing the sounds that I want or sound the way I thought they\\'d sound (except my Kala soprano with solid spruce top, that thing is bright as duck)I also felt that they weren\\'t really good with finger picking or classical solos - the nylgut-esque material of the Aquila kind of sticks to your hands, or is easy to get caught in your fingernails if you are a fingernail picker (like a classical guitarist, which I am not because I dislike long grey nasty fingernails, no offense). Still, I blamed the fault to my lack of skills and perhaps improper ukulele setup, because, well, Aquila is like ukulele string god.\\n\\nRecently, I decided to purchase more Martin strings to put on my Kala ASLAS, because Aquila + solid spruce top + soprano size = ear piercing high shrill sound. Since Amazon sells M600 as \"add-on\" items, I bought a ukulele song book + 3 sets of these martins.\\n\\nLong story short: I have just now restrung all my soprano ukues with these Martin M600s, and THEY ARE FANTASTIC. I have fallen in love with ukulele all over again. Sure, the Aquila is bright, happy, and bouncy sounding that is really good for strumming, I feel like they aren\\'t really suited for the smaller size ukes (soprano and perhaps even concert). One of the things I felt was that my concert sounded more clear and pure, with each string singing beautifully when strummed, and that sopranos sounded muddy in comparison. I thought it was just the difference between the two sizes. HOWEVER, with the M600s, my sopranos sound MUCH better. When strummed you can feel and hear each string contributing to the overarching harmony. It is truly beautiful. Also, these clear nylon strings have made arpeggios and classicals much easier and pleasurable to play. Also they sound better.\\n\\nWith the M600 my ukes have lost a bit of the bounciness that the Aquila gives. However, they were already very uke-sounding ukuleles to begin with, now they sound much more balanced. Below you will find what I thought about the M600 on my ukes:\\n\\nPono Mahogany Soprano:\\n\\nTo be honest, I was really disappointed with this Pono when first got it, and I expected the most of it out of the three I have, because Kala is just a cheap brand made in China. Pono is still made in China, but they have their own factory (Kala shares factory space with Lanikai and many other uke makers), own training and culture, and they are all inspected and set up in Hawaii at the Koolau factory. However, there was nothing special with the sound - with stock strings it sounded dead, and with Aquilas it sounds bouncy and bright but not as fun as the Kala soprano.\\n\\nWith the M600, I can finally understand why mahogany soprano ukuleles were so so so popular back then. The factory strings really muted out the sweet and docile tone, while the Aquila strings overrode the tone with its own bright bouncy sound. However, with the M600 everything is balanced and nice. I can really hear the wood sing!\\n\\nPutting M600 on my Pono also took care of some weird issues I had with tuning and buzzing. Now the friction tuners work wonderfully and I actually love them now (before the M600s, I was ready to swear off of friction tuner ukes for the rest of my life). The pono now strums and picks beautifully, sounding sweet and clear as ever.\\n\\nKala Soprano Lacewood:\\n\\nIt is now less edgy, THANK GOODNESS! This uke sounded so bright that videos of it causes my speakers to buzz. Now it still have that hard, clear spruce tone, minus the over-bounciness and edginess. It is still a bit bright, but compliments the mellow Pono perfectly.\\n\\nTuning and playability have also improved, just as with the Pono. I must sound like I work for Martin but swear I don\\'t. With the Kala I always had problem with the E string staying in tune (even took apart the friction tuners, put together and restrung, and tightened the screw). However, after restrung with M600 it has stayed in tune since!\\n\\nAnyway, these are awesome. Aquilas are over-used everywhere now and I think people are realize it is just a hype. Aquila strings really make lower end ukuleles sing, such as with the Makala Dolphine, that the bounciness works very well with the dolphine\\'s plastic body. However, if you have a solid instrument, Aquila does not really add much to it. Even my Makala Pineapple, now that I think about it - I had so much fun with it BECAUSE it was strung with the martins! After I got my other ukes (remember, they came with extra sets of Aquilas), I restrung my Makala with the Aquilas, and quickly lost interest in the Makala.\\n\\nThe end.', 'I put these on my son\\'s uke (a $20 beginner model) and the first thing I noticed was the warm tone.\\n\\nOf course, warm tone isn\\'t that important to me...the uke was a gift for his first birthday.\\n\\nWhat has truly impressed me is that they lasted nine months of him pounding on them as only a one-year-old can.

( Be sure to read instructions well, so the screws are in the exact correct location. ) The screws click into the round objects, and the whole unit keeps the autoharp up higher without hurting your arms. For myself, I had to shorten the slider strap on the sewing machine to make it the right size for me. It feels very secure & you can tell it is not going to fall apart & let the autoharp hit the floor.

If you are unfamiliar, tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidly.\\n\\nThe Boss TR-2 is the simplest of the three stompboxes to operate, with three controls: \"Rate\" of modulation, \"Depth\" of modulation (how much does the volume vary), and a \"Wave\" shape (jagged, square, or somewhere on a continuum in between).

Most tremolos have it, but not all. For the price, it can give you a decent set of classic tremolo sounds with nothing too crazy. It is the unit that Tom Morello uses on \"Guerilla Radio,\" and it does well with tremolo classics like the Smiths \"How Soon Is Now?\" I hear no volume drop problem like other reviews suggest, and this is something I am sensitive to because I generally turn modulations on/off over the course of a song rather than leave them on full time.\\n\\nLike all Boss stuff, the box is sturdy and I like their big, quiet footswitches over any of the little, clicky ones on other units.

I deal in used guitars, picked up an Epi Special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap. I didn\\'t mess with it until I was ready to set it up for resale. I fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars, even a lot of higher end guitars need it. I found on the Special ll the frets were actually very well done (Chinese version from 2011) and only needed a slight leveling (would have played fine without it but I am very picky). It didn\\'t take much to get it set up, small truss rod adjustment, new set of 10\\'s for strings. little bit of adjustment to the bridge, cut the nut a bit....note it played well the way I got it, just like my stuff perfect. Got it set-up and plugged it in to check the electronics and that\\'s when I started to really become impressed with this guitar. Cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character, these sounded pretty good, actually very good, nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end. I check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks. It cut through really well. I noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and didn\\'t lose any highs when turned down. The tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep, very nice. I popped off the back cover to check what was in there, full sized pots, maybe not the best quality but much better than expected. I normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way I like but no need to fix what\\'s not broken. Yup, I said \"on my personal guitars\" because I am keeping this one for myself. The neck is very fast and comfy, it\\'s NOT a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me. The tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine, once again if it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it. Please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut. I\\'ve set-up hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work, doesn\\'t matter what price point you are at. This also has a bolt on neck. A lot of players say you have to have a set (glued) neck. I feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit, I prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound, IMO. I have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good. I know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the Special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking. My advice is to go try one, my taste may not be the same as yours. There are a lot of good value well made guitars now-a-days, I just found at this price vs quality ratio the Epiphone Special ll really is special. Get one, get it set up for a few bucks if you can\\'t do it yourself, and you will have a good instrument.

It's a lot easier and faster to adjust the screw on the Shubb than it is to have to recheck the tuning on each string every time I move a Kyser capo.

The pickups, tune-o-matic bridge and stop piece are the same ones used in Epiphone\\'s more expensive guitars, and are similar to what\\'s used in much more expensive Gibsons. Although the tone adjustments have been simplified to a toggle between the three pickup combinations and an overall tone control for both pickups, this is not as big a deal as many might make of it. Given the vast array of other things that influence electric guitar sound -- strings, amp choice and settings, effects pedals and so forth -- the guitar sounds great as is.\\n\\nThe finish and general fit and balance of the guitar are great. There was a time when budget guitars screamed cheap and were quite obviously low class in a lot of areas. Those days are past with the Epiphone LP Special II.\\n\\nAll that said, there a few things to remember.\\n\\n* The guitar comes with very light bendy strings. This is probably due to market data that tells Epiphone that the bulk of buyers for this guitar are teen Guitar Heros who think that string bending every note is an essential aspect of shredding and wailing. If you plan to put heavier strings on the guitar (like 12-51s for example) for jazz or other styles of music then you will probably need a truss rod adjustment to compensate for the added tension. If you don\\'t know how to do this, ask someone who does. You can ruin a guitar, permanently, by being too aggressive with a truss rod adjustment.\\n\\n* The guitar has a mahogany neck, but a basswood body. Do not let anyone tell you this is a bad thing. Basswood is a completely acceptable wood for musical instruments. It is not worse or better than mahogany or maple. It is just different. Once again, the differences involved will probably be irrelevant when added into all the other things that players do with amps, strings and pedals to create tone and sound from an electric guitar.\\n\\n* Epiphone has more than one factory making these guitars. One is in China, the other in is Indonesia. The guitars made by each are very close in every detail, but not exactly, perfectly the same.\\n\\n* The Chinese examples of the sunburst model that I have seen have a slightly golden-orange tone to the sunburst pattern, more like the traditional sunburst color in American guitars. The Indonesian examples I have seen have a much more over all orange look. Basswood does not have a lot of visible grain. The example guitar shown in the official Epiphone product photos, the photos you see on most web sites like Amazon and Musician\\'s Friend and so forth, are probably a little optimistic when it comes to visible grain and the golden hued quality of the sunburst finish.\\n\\n* The Chinese examples I have seen tend to weigh more. One Indonesian model I saw weighed a full pound and half less than the Chinese model right next to it. There is not, unfortunately, any way to tell from the box or from the barcode or SKU number on the box what factory a given example inisde the box came from. The system will deal out whatever is in stock at the moment.\\n\\nThe world is full of guys who will zero in on all the details they find inferior about this guitar by noting the rather obvious fact that this is not a Gibson Les Paul Standard costing $3,000.00. There are some people who will complain that this guitar has a bolt on neck. True, the set necks of the more expensive Epiphones and Gibsons are nicer. But, considering the fact that every Fender Stratocaster ever made had a bolt on neck, is this really a big deal? Would Jimi Hendrix have played \"Purple Haze\" better if his Strat had a set in neck? Probably not.\\n\\nThe guitar this model is probably closest to, in spirit and purpose, is not the Gibson Les Pauls but, rather, to the old Gibson Melody Maker guitars from the 60s. That said, this is a hell of lot more guitar for the money than any Melody Maker ever was, and adjusted for inflation, relative to what a Melody Maker would have cost you in 1968, for example, it is almost like Epiphone paying you to play it.\\n\\nPeople listen to music, not guitars. Music is made by players, not by pickups and electronics. If you\\'re on a budget, this is an outstanding choice. If you\\'re not on a budget, it\\'s still a very good basic instrument.

The old and new are of the same excellent quality over all these years.\\n\\nI was just ordering another set for a new bass, and thought I\\'d add some info which I didn\\'t see in the top reviews.  The first bit of info is that this model is called \"Dual Design\" because the Straplok mechanism locks into the center of the buttons on the body, but there\\'s also a regular flange on the button as well.  If you arrive at a gig and realize you left your strap which has the other end of the Straplok at home, you can easily fit a regular strap over the big flange, so you\\'re always covered. The original Straplok design wasn\\'t like this - the button was not shaped in a way that could hold a strap.  This is a really nice part of the design.  Even if you don\\'t use the Straplok, they\\'re the best strap buttons available.\\n\\nYou can\\'t see it in the Amazon pictures, but the way the locking mechanism works is that the mechanism on the strap has a spring-loaded plunger in the middle of cylinder. There are three tiny ball bearings that project out past the side of the cylinder until you press the plunger button (then they fall under the surface).  To lock the strap on, you push the button on the end of your strap, which lets the balls fall in and insert this pin into the hole in the middle of the strap button on the body.  Inside that strap button, there\\'s a circumferential notch.  When you let go of the plunger, the balls pop back out and fit into that notch, holding the two pieces very firmly together, but with full 360 degree rotation.\\n\\nYou do have to make sure that the pins stay relatively clean so the ball bearings can move in and out and you need to make sure that you insert the strap pin all the way into the button, but it works really well.\\n\\nThe only bad things about this design are that you need a pretty small phillips screwdriver to install the button on your guitar (the tip has to fit inside the locking hole.  The screws that some with the Straplok have a special narrow head to fit.  You do need to get these strap buttons on tight for it to work securely.  The other bad thing (mentioned in many reviews) is that the strap attachment sits the full height of the button away from the guitar body (they didn\\'t want to make you drill a big hole in the guitar so the hole would be sunken under the surface.  If you use your strap as strain relief for your cord, it makes it work less effectively.\\n\\nThe alternative straplock is the Schaller.  That system uses a very small button on the instrument (can\\'t hold a regular strap) but grabs the button with a cup, so once it\\'s engaged there\\'s no question it will hold it up.  They\\'re both good systems, but if you forget your Schaller-equipped strap, you\\'re not going to be able to jury rig a replacement.\\n\\nEnjoy them!', 'nice', 'Nice product.

Professionals and novices use them alike because of their reported easiness and functionality. Because of their reputation, I picked up one a couple years ago to use as an alternative to a micrometer capo. Today, I just about never use the Kyser. Here's why:\\n\\nFrom day one, the Kyser was always extremely stiff. While it's no secret that the springs on these need a certain amount of use to break in, the spring today is still not much better. When placed correctly, the capo generally keeps good intonation. However, I've found that it often takes several re-positions to get the right sound. The capo works good at capo 1&2, but will almost guaranteed pull the strings out of tune at capo 3 onwards. If the capo is pulling the strings so much as to majorly de-tune them (more than a half-step over time) imagine what it is doing to the frets for wear? The Kyser may be the quickest and easiest capo to change, but the bottom line is that it's tension is alarmingly tight and has the potential to damage the neck over time. If you're working off a cheaper guitar that you don't care too much about, the Kyser is no doubt the easiest and most convenient capo choice. I would by no means recommend this capo if you are using an expensive guitar due to it's tendency to over-exert pressure. Capos like the Shubb or G7th offer you the ability to adjust tension while still retaining much functionality ease. For expensive guitars, I'd spend a couple extra bucks and check out one of those.

I've never lost a C-clip from a set (which holds the lock together on the strap), but even if one were to pop off during use, the strap still won't come off the instrument. I've had several bandmates use Schaller locks that lost the nuts on stage, and seen guitars go crashing to the floor as a result. Schallers also tend to unscrew the buttons from the guitars more easily than Dunlops. Other new designed locks seem to utilize Dunlop's ball bearing concept,\\n\\nThe Dual Design are my favorites, because the strap buttons will hold a strap without the lock in a pinch. Buttons on Dunlop Original or Schaller aren't quite as user friendly.\", \"Easy to install and easy to use.  While I wouldn't call this a required item for an electric guitar, it does hold straps securely in place by means of ball bearings which securely slide into a groove in the mounting pin.  I feel much more secure with this system that an eyelet of my guitar strap will not suddenly slip from one of the mounts on the instrument.\\n\\nInstallation was not without some work, as one of the mounting pins would not adequately secure itself as the screw chewed through the wood.  Wood glue, masking tape and 12 hours of curing time fixed that little problem and the pin is now secure in the guitar.  Worse case, one could use epoxy to glue it in, or fill the original screw hole and drill a new one.  Using screws of different widths is not advisabe, as they will not consistently seat within the mounting pin, blocking the strap lock from engaging.\", \"I have been using Dunlop Straploks since they were first invented twenty some odd years ago, or is it thirty some odd years ago. I still use the first. second and third sets on the same guitars and never had a failure of any kind.\\nThe new sets I just bought are identical to the sets I bought many years ago.

Have also tried running it straight in to a recording device, and the result is always the same: a god-awful, horrible-sounding muddy tone that cannot be helped with all the EQ in the world. It is not good for metal, or any other genre for that matter. I realize it is probably not meant to record with, but i feel that anybody who is searching for a good studio guitar tone should certainly look elsewhere. If you have a combo amp, the distortion on it is probably way better than you will get with this pedal.

The other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular. I also other Boss Distortion pedals. Like most people, I own a DS-1 and an MD-2 which are both cheap and effective. I own a HM-2 Heavy Metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and I actually think this pedal is more versatile IMO with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone.\\n\\nI also own an older 80's HM-2 Heavy Metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that I could never part with, overall i like this pedal, but it cannot top the older legendary Boss pedals.\", 'Thin, silky, and stretchable.

Once you have these installed, you are going to feel confident that your instrument is not going to slip out of the strap if you lean the wrong way. This is because you have to press the button to place the strap on the guitar, and when you release the button, it's locked in place. You repeat the process to remove the strap, which you can now use on another guitar or bass that has the system.\", \"I'm finding that I like these a lot better than the Schaller ones.

This pedal is great, only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock, or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I don't understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp, but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal.\", \"Good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone (most metal pedals do) and is moderately noisy.

I wanted the simplicity and quick release when I pulled my bass out of the case I wanted to be able to quickly have the strap on and on securely.

Overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be.  I run a Randall G3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state I've used or heard.  For recording I use a Peavey 5150 and its so sweet.  Tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.\\n\\nRecently I started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that I felt like could only be achieved through a pedal.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, I used the DOD death metal for years when I first started playing.  However, there is a downside.  Go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old AM radio, if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250.  Quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.\\n\\nI chose the MT-2 because I know Boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using.  It gives a variety of sounds.  It can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones.  The controls make it very tweakable and I have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it.  Read the included book, look up some MP3s over videos online and check out other guitarists' settings.  It will help you tame this pedal into what you want.  Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot.  There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.\\n\\nI've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz.  I must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig.  Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT-2.  I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response.\\n\\nI say the MT-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal.  Surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board.\", 'Its a great pedal, sound really crunchy, I got a peavy vyper sometime I use this If I want a crunchy style, but the amp I got is really good and has its own distortion styles, I use the heavy metal config on this pedal, I recomend it to anyone... does not introduce noise, I run it on the stock battery, it still works, you can make your guitar sound like Metallica or Megadeth, of course it also depends on a lot of things, like pickups, amp, etc..., I also have a very old little peavey practice amp, this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life.\\nListen to it on the Boss website, I heard to it and then I thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them, but it does sound really really close. regards. forgive my english... not from the U.S', 'I have a lot of pedals...  In fact, I have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals (though only the MT2 and the OD3 are regularly in my rig.)  This pedal won\\'t give you a \"cranked up tube stack\" sound.  No...  Instead, it\\'s very edgy and smooth as can be.  It has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone.  I usually use it as a mid-boost for solos.  You\\'ll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you won\\'t be able to replicate (easily... I\\'m sure the huge Boss distortion box comes close, but for the price...) with any other pedal.', \"I've had this for about 11 years now. Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market, this pedal still sells well. Not to mention, it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They're usually on the side of improving the stock tone, which I'm happy with.\\n\\nI've always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music, the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain, I punch it up with an overdrive, or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost, I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter, more technical styles, it's better not to have too much gain anyhow.\", 'Great product!', 'Great, easy to use.', 'Took FOREVER to arrive. Looked great.

I eventually did without damage.\\n\\n2) As someone recommended, be sure that the provided screw fits easily into the guitar\\'s original hole.

I have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless.  The product comes in a clam shell package.  For me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some.  There are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box wasn't fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere.  I found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is useless.\\nThe product is too inexpensive to bother with a return.

The worst part is that the right angle section with the switch has a very precarious connection to ground. The design has a screw making connection to the braid and the housing, which is then supposed to connect to the sleeve connection on the input. However, if you wiggle it just right, this ground connection is lost and it will buzz.\\n\\nI fixed this by popping off (not easy) the two end caps on the right angle connector, soldering a wire from the braid directly to the sleeve connection, and then putting it back together (again, not easy).

Tight, nice fit.', \"Clipping onto the rim might take a minute or two, but it is no problem. The adjustable clip mount is convenient. The material is mildly flexible, like a firm rubber, so there is very little risk of breaks if your drummer is wild and hits it (God forbid), but that means it is very wobbly and you will see your mic moving back and forth. HOWEVER, there is no noticeable change in the sound because of this. To my ears, at least, the tones and levels are consistent throughout tracking. I've used an SM57 and Audix i5 with this and both are long and kind of heavy which I'm sure contributes to the wobble.\\nIt does stand several inches above the snare, which I can imagine can get in the way of a drummer moving from snare to hihat or whatever the situation may be if they have a tight kit, where just a level boom stand sneaking in between the drums would actually be better. In my opinion this is worth getting just to have as backup or as an alternative to have a clean kit micing setup and to set aside an extra stand.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nA client I was recording had to remove the clip during the session to adjust his snare and tried to clip it back on himself, resulting in a snap in the curved part at the bottom of the photo.

As soon as you release the button, the circuit becomes active again, along with any noise.\\n\\nIn all fairness, the cable works 100% as designed, flawlessly, but it doesn't do what I hoped it would do.

Just push the button in, let go and push it again when you are ready to go. I just don\\'t like the push button as well as before, it\\'s probably just me but this seems a little more cheaply made.

So... the only thing I would add to the other reviews on this item is that what I said in the title:  Heavier microphones may bounce a bit when using these mounts.  The plastic is sturdy to stay in place, but a bit flexible.  It has to be to allow you to bend the clip over the rim of the drum.  I use different mics for different drums and noticed that a Shure SM57 stays in place pretty good, but other mics I've used (including the Sennheiser MD 421 and others) tend to cause the end to flex under the weight of the mic--especially when miking the resonant side (bottom head) of the snare.  So if you use heavier microphones than SM57s, be aware that they could bounce a bit during recording/performance.\", 'I own 5 of these.  I also own the drum mic mounts that came with my ElectroVoice PL35 microphones.\\n\\nI purchased these because of the reviews I read stating that they do not touch the \"rim\" of your drum head like the clips that came with my PL 35\\'s did.\\n\\nThis is not entirely true however.  They DO TOUCH the \"rim\" of the drum head, but that depends on the depth of the hoop itself and how far inside the hoop the rim of your drum head lies.\\n\\ndepending on the depth of the drum hoop, if not deep enough, this mount will rest against the drum head rim putting upwards pressure on the drum head... essentially in opposition of the tension used to tune the drum.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nPearl World Series drum hoop, this mount only clips onto / makes contact with the drum hoop.\\nPearl Reference drum hoop, this mount clips onto the drum hoop on top and the bottom of the clip makes contact with and puts upwards pressure on the drum heads metal rim - NOT the drum hoop.\\n\\nSo it depends on the \"depth\" of the drum hoop this mount is used on.\\n\\nIf the metal rim of your drum head is FLUSH with, or sticks out farther than the flange of the drum hoop, then this mount WILL touch / butt up against the rim of the head (NOT the drum hoop like it should) and it will put upwards pressure on the metal / aluminum rim of the drumhead (I am referring to the metal \"ring\" that is part of the drum head which the actual plastic / mylar portion of the drum head is mounted / glued onto).\\n\\nI put this clamp on 4 different drums.  A Pearl Reference tom, a Pearl World Series tom, a Tama Artwood snare drum, and a Pulse percussion piccolo snare drum (lol, ya I know, cheap arse drum).\\n\\nThe only drum that this clip did not come into contact with the drumhead rim was the Pearl World Series tom.  All others IT DID touch the rim of the head within the flange of the drum hoop and apply pressure to it.\\n\\nHOWEVER:  I did play my Pearl Reference tom without the clip on it, hit it and listened very closely, I then put the clip on it, hit it and listened very closely.  There was NO DIFFERENCE in the sond / tone / sustain / or over tones.  It does seem that even with this clip touching the rim of the drumhead it does not effect the sound of the drum.\\n\\nThis clip is MUCH thinner and flexible than the clips that came with my PL35\\'s, and that might have something to do with it...?\\n\\nThis clip is easy to put on and take off.  The clips that came with my PL35\\'s are VERY RIGID, THICK, AND DIFFICULT to put on and take off.\\n\\nId say overall (so far) that these clips probably would work well.  Thats is all I can say at this point however because I still need to really \"put them to use\".\\n\\nIf you think that these mic mounts WONT touch the rim of your drum head you are most likely mistaken or misinformed.  Again that would depend on how far the rim of your drum head sits within the flange of your drum hoop.  This mic mount does put far less pressure on the rim of the drum head than other similar mounts because it is far more pliable/flexible and also thinner in that area.  It does seem to be strong enough to with stand repeated use (taking on and off).\\n\\nI will update this review after a few weeks use and with some pictures as well.\\n\\nI hope this review helps you decide.\\n\\ngood luck!', 'The quality of the manufacturing is top notch.

Probably the jack will break if I continue to use it on these guitars.  It works wonderfully on both my Jazz basses.  One is a Fender and the other is a vintage 70's Ibanez Jazz bass.

Here are my pros and cons:\\nPros\\n1. It works. I tested in Sony Vegas pro with and without the filter. The \"pop\" sound is completely removed with the filter. Which means it does what it was designed to do. 5-stars. It does not affect voice volume at all, just smooths those rough edges in your speech :D\\n2. It looks nice. Attached to my Blue Snowball, it looks like a professional product. It doesn\\'t really matter since I work from home and not in a public place, but it\\'s nice to know I can show it to people and it \"looks nice\"\\n3. The clamp, bendable arm, and everything work appropriately. The clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface. So mounting this to, say, a desk probably won\\'t be a stable as attached to a round thing, like the stem to a mic.\\n4. I don\\'t know why people think this \"isn\\'t sturdy\"...I mean you\\'re not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing. The build quality is quite excellent considering that it\\'s 2 fragile screens attached to plastic and metal.\\n\\nCons\\n1. It\\'s pretty big. I used to shorten the stem on my Blue Snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage. I can\\'t do that anymore with this pop filter on it. Now it\\'s become a permanent member of the front of my desk.\\n\\nOutside of this thing doubling the space my Snowball takes up, I have no complaints about this pop filter. It works well, it attaches nicely, it does what it is supposed to do, it looks nice, and the quality is good. This should be the last pop filter I have to buy for a long time.', 'Very adjustable and convenient pop filter. Much better than stretching a pantyhose over a bent coat hanger.

I used to use Schaller brand locks before switching to Dunlop. I find the Dunlop to be less dangerous around the finish of my guitar. The strap side of the Schaller locks have some pretty sharp edges that can leave nasty dings in the guitar finish if you are not careful. The Dunlop brand is much smoother in this respect. Many feel the Dunlop locks are too long and will stick out from the guitar more than Schaller but I don't have a problem with that. I feel confident that my guitar is not going to come loose and crash to the floor (with either lock system- but prefer Dunlop).\", \"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops, and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past, on friends' guitars, semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast, these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still, the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes, making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch, using the posts like the OEM ones.

The one I received differs from the one they show in ad. I have the 15 foot version and it holds its own with Mogami in a live setting. When I recorded with it, that's when you hear the difference. Not to say it's a bad cable, I'm falling in love with it. But when you're recording, you can see why Mogami is the industry standard. It did a great job recording but not nearly as good as Mogami. When people tell you cheap cables work just as well as the higher end ones, IE; Mogami, Monster, Klotz, George L to name a few, they do not know their cables. That or they are just playing from home or jamming with a small band in the garage. Making an investment in a good cable pays off. With the lifetime warranty, the sound, durability and the quality, you will be paying less and sounding much better in the end. One and you're done. It goes bad, all you do it take it to a local authorized dealer and they will hand you a brand new one.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nI would highly recommend this cable as it does what it says it will and gets rid of that accidental POP when you unplug. You get a really nice tone with it, no tone coloring or hum. It does a fine job when used in a recording setting, but a even better job in a live setting. The more I use this cable when I'm playing live, the more I'm loving it. Sure I love my Mogami with the Nuetrik Silent Plug jack.

Nevertheless, I\\'m pleasantly surprised with this capp. I have another, what I would call a \"lever-action\" capo, that I got for about the same price. I have been reasonably happy with that one, but this particular capo exerts more pressure than the G7th capo I bought for easily twice the price. In fact, I find this one to be a better capo than the G7th. MOre than likely, I will robably alternate between my new Shubb and this capo, so I am very happy with it.', \"Does what it's supposed to do.\", 'Works as well as any Kyser capo. My favorites.

The screws that come with the straplock are longer and/or thicker than the standard ones on the SG.  Therefore, I did not want to force the dunlop screws into the guitar.

I\\'ve decided to try these because they use a \"dual\" system: you can use the lock on your strap, or just use your \"regular\" strap without the locking mechanism. I\\'ve only been using these for a week, but so far, I like them much better than Fender\\'s. I think I will replace all Fender straplocks with these.\\nI do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality, and the screw heads will strip if you\\'re not careful. When I was installing these strap nuts, I screw in a half turn at a time, and applied lots of pressure so that the the head won\\'t strip. If you can get over the installation, you got yourself a pretty good locking strap.', \"Dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it's a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing.

My old Alvarez had a switch on the preamp which prevented the \"pop\" when removing the cord.  Fender does not have this as don\\'t most acoustic/electric guitars.  Why not?  If there is no switch, you must remove the cord to prevent the preamp from draining it\\'s battery. The switch one this cord works great.  No more popping.\\n\\nNote, turning off the cord switch does not turn off the preamp.  It only prevents the pop when removing the cable from the guitar.', \"The circuit breaker on/off switch really made switching guitars easy without turning down volume on amplifier...

For the Martin GPCPA5 acoustic/electric guitar, the right angle 1/4 plug was pushed in but can't achieve the solid click.. Just flushed tight only .. During my 20 minutes testing, it came loose twice dropping connection ... I know with my Live wire elite 10' cable, I was able to get a solid click connection with both the Martin and the Gibson.

Perhaps if I ever have to go on stage with this cable, I will have to limit my movements so the plug won't come loose with my Martjn guitar.

After an unfortunate \"drop\", I would highly recommend protecting your investment with these strap locks.  A little drilling involved for install on Les Pauls (the front button by the neck, not the rear button near the back of the guitar since Gibson uses 2 different screw sizes for the strap buttons).  Use caution when installing so you don\\'t drill the hole too wide and need to fill with wood putty.', 'The very first thing I noticed about the design is how far from the guitar\\'s surface the strap is actually connected.  What this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitar\\'s weight.  The \"fulcrum\" is the surface of the wood, if this makes sense, and I can\\'t help but wonder if it could eventually (eventually over much time and use) cause cracks or splits as a result.\\n\\nI found someone selling only the Dunlop strap buttons, which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars, and was about to order them when I found Planet Waves Elliptical End Pins.  I think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap, unless you\\'re going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders, and no additional stress on the guitar\\'s body.  I\\'ve ordered a set.', \"Great product, I've use them before and have always thought they were top quality.  They aren't much larger than the originals that came with the guitar and that extra piece of mind is great!  Easy installation without any modification (at least on mine) and they connect/hold very solid.  Just make sure the buttons are all the way in or you could have mishap ;)\", 'I have put these on all my guitars, and even have an extra for when I add a new guitar to my collection.  Easy to use and pretty stylish. I have some in black and silver.', 'Perfect.', 'LOVE IT!!! Here\\'s the deal: All of my guitars have the cable plug as the strapholder, so the right angle of this cable is an enormous benefit for me. First of all, the cable stays in, and it simply looks much better (not easily visible when you\\'re on stage).\\n\\nThe circuit breaker button (\"integrated Mute Switch for silent instrument changes\") on the right angle portion of the cable allows you to turn the cable off, so to speak. So if you need to switch to another guitar, or if you are late for a sound check and everything is plugged in already, you can easily get this cable connected (with the circuit breaker on), plug in and then \"turn the cable on\" by pushing the switch again  avoiding angry looks from sound technicians who hate it when you cause loud pops or hissing & squealing.\\n\\nThe main reason I got this cable was because of the shielding. I had a large number of older cables, but they started to deteriorate. So I\\'m getting a couple more of these cables (in different lengths) to replace my old arsenal. What I really like about the quality of this cable are the  24k gold-plated plugs (which provide \"superior signal flow and corrosion resistance\"). I can definitely attest to the superior signal flow. I\\'m mostly a guitarist and not a huge hardware guy, but when I read \"utilize ultra-pure, oxygen-free copper conductors for low capacitance and pure tone\" and \"two layers of shielding provide 100% coverage for superior insulation and noise rejection, making this the ultimate, high-performance cable\" I was sold.\\n\\nI have not had a single problem with this cable.

However, once you climb that learning curve it is simple.\\n\\nIt\\'s also effective. The fabric has a silky feel that appears to have a high thread count of some synthetic thread. It will completely keep dust off the top surface of your keyboard, which will gunk both the keys and the electronic controls. Also, it\\'s relatively simple to keep clean: either vacuum it or go over it with a duster.\\n\\nOn my board there is ample room for the cover to also fit over my pedal, power and output signal cables. However it also folds into a compact form factor. It arrived in a plastic pouch that measured 9.5\" x 6\" x 1.75\".  I did mention that it\\'s super thin and those folded dimensions, compared to the size when unfolded and on the board, will give you an idea as to just how thin it is.\\n\\nAlthough it is flimsy it does exactly what you want it to: protect a much higher investment in your instrument. From that perspective it\\'s a value and I - for one - am pleased with it because before I got it I constantly worried about the effects of dust on my keyboard.', 'Although this cover is a tight fit, it works perfectly with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Roland-V-Combo-VR-700/dp/B0035JDZDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Roland V-Combo VR-700</a>&nbsp;(that board\\'s exact dimensions are 51.5\" long x 16.25\" wide x 4.785\" high.

Considering the dimensions stretched over the keyboard, how small it is folded will give an idea about just how thin the material is.\\n\\nSince this was a tight fit over my board I did not need to use the added drawstring that allows you to adjust it for smaller boards. However, that string is the key to making this work with smaller 76- and 61-key boards. Believe me, the material is slippery enough to need this adjustment because I own the large model of this cover for an 88-key and it will shoot off like a slingshot if not adjusted tight for smaller dimensions.\\n\\nFlimsy it may be, but it is effective and I feel as though I got a lot of value for the price because it\\'s protecting a much larger investment in my instrument.', \"I like these straplocks, but they were a little tight to get on a Levy's strap.

Which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap. There was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time. One component, which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions weren't much help either. The directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go, but I didn't know the name of the piece nor could I readily find it in there. After that, I installed this into my new guitar and strap and, I was ready to go. I HIGHLY recommend this!

They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!\\n2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.\\n3- Cheap. They just feel cheap.

With the right angle it sits very well in my guitar stand too. The preamp on my guitar isn't very handy and doesn't have a mute switch or a tuner installed just a volume and a tone control.

They are the gold standard and Mercedes Benz of harps. The sound is Mellifluous and the harmonicas are durable and resilient if taken care of properly.\\nBut allow me to elaborate on the \"key\" reasons you should consider buying Hohner harmonicas.\\n\\nA SOLID REPUTATION\\n\\nHohner has been manufacturing, handcrafted, high-quality harmonicas since 1857. It is the preferred instrument of choice for legendary performers such as: Sonny Boy Williamson, Little Walter, Bob Dylan and even John Lennon to just name a few. Yes, you pay extra, but Horner harmonicas are worth the investment. They don\\'t make cheap harmonicas.\\n\\nONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL\\n\\nSince Hohner specializes in harmonicas, they offer a smart variety to suit your musical needs: Diatonic, Chromonica, MS Series, Tremlo, Orchestra and more. Each one of these harmonicas will assure you the best instrument for your performance or musical group.\\n\\nGREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE & RESOURCES\\n\\nHarmonicas fatigue and eventually need repair and tuning just like any other musical instrument and it is reassuring to know that Hohner\\'s got you covered and have customer service and various resources to keep you jamming along.\\n\\nTHERE ARE HEALTH BENEFITS\\n\\nDid you know playing the harmonica is also healthy for your lungs? Recent studies show that harmonica therapy is helping patients in the recovery process pulmonary rehab. Harmonica is the only instrument that your breath in and out to produce sound. As a singer it helps me strengthen diaphragmatic breathing.\\n\\nDO YOU NEED A \"MARINE BAND?\"\\n\\nAside from popularity, the Marine Band has a distinctive Pearwood Comb and produces luscious melodies. It is a 10 hole diatonic harmonica. Again, since 1896, this is a tried and true instrument played the world over . So I always will be inclined to pay extra money for a Hohner harmonica.\\n\\nWHICH KEY DO YOU NEED?\\n\\nHere is a helpful key chart. Don\\'t make the mistake of purchasing a harp in the key of E if a song is in the key of E (you actually want to buy a A Key for a song played in E).\\n\\nSong Key Played / Harmonica Key Needed\\n\\n  E/ A\\n  F /B-FLAT\\n  G/ C\\n  A/ D\\n  B/ E\\n  C / F\\n  D/ G', \"Although bassist typically don't use capos I found this one helpful for checking fret buzz when placed at the first fret thereby leaving your hands free to check for string height along the remaining frets.

The right angle plug is fantastic, as the plug lies flat and doesn't get in the way. The instructions don't say clearly how to cut the cable and reconnect it to the plug should you need to. I guess I'll just figure it out when I need to. Twenty feet seems quite alright. Not too long and not too short. I've stepped on the cable countless times and haven'd found any damage. The cable doesn't scuff, so it still looks really good. The cable looks like a coaxial design, which I think is less good sounding than a balanced, two conductor design (as a audiophile, I've built my own interconnect cables and there is a big improvement in sound quality using 2-conductor balanced-design cables versus coaxial).

If you use the first hole on the capo which you will be inclined to do. You may scratch your neck because the metal on the capo is coming in contact with your guitar neck. So no matter how tight the elastic is or how thick your guitar neck is you must I repeat must use the second hole for the metal on the first one will be covered by elastic.\\n\\n2. Taking the cable off the capo can be tricky. As soon as you unhook the elastic the metal rings on the elastic can scrape your guitar neck. Now I've scratched my tailor when I first tried to escape on it and I've also decided to order another one for my Martin backpacker. You wonder why there's two ways it can scratch your guitar because I scratch to separate guitars.\\n\\nAs a side note I've used the old walnut trick to get rid of the scratches. If you do not know this trick be sure to look it up.\\n\\nAlso another side note to take this cable off properly I would push to keep up against the strings so that when you touch the elastic it does not scratch your guitar neck. I have to say I'm shocked that no one else has had this problem that I've had but I felt that you needed to be warrant.\\n\\nNow that all that is out of the way.

An absolutely outstanding way to treat customers I would only hope that some other companies start to treat people the same way.\\n\\nThe Kyser Capo itself is a great Capo with just one major flaw which depending on how you look at it can be a major flaw or a minor flaw. The problem is the adjustability of the tension. There are YouTube videos out there from Kyser themselves explaining how you can actually been this into adjustability that you can work with. The problem is it doesn't exactly work is easily as they say it does. They are absolutely wonderful to deal with and they actually replaced an older capo for me free of charge. They claim that the older materials were not conducive to flexibility so they took it upon themselves to offer me a newer model. I appreciated that so much by that company that I ordered this one on Amazon just to show my support. Unfortunately it is still extremely difficult to pin this item to the desire tension that you needed for various guitar. Again I feel it is in either minor or major flaw depending on how many times you use it how many different guitars you use with it and so on. Myself, find this to be a minor flaw which is why I feel it gets an outstanding four star review. Of course with this one drawback it prevents me from giving it that final V Star which I allocate for absolutely perfect products that work flawlessly for me.\\n\\nKyser is an absolutely wonderful company to work with and they were very accommodating and I appreciate that and I will continue to support them and use their Capo happily, butt I just feel that it comes ever so sure of that 5-star because of that one option.\\n\\nNow as far as the rest of the Capo goes it is of course very easy to take on and off, attached to the end of the headstock if you wish, to get enough tension on just about any acoustic 6 string guitar that you're using it on. I don't believe that weight is really that significant for CatOS in this day in age, but to be thorough it is obviously a very light unobtrusive object to keep on the neck. It doesn't make the neck heavier and does not seem to alter the way the guitar feels feels in any way shape or form. It opens and closes snugly but you should be able to get used to that rather quickly. It is made like a truck so I don't believe you will have any problems in a year or 30 years. And I believe that the parts are replaceable where there is were possible. As stated before because of the great white shark like tension on this item you will not have a problem with string buzzing because of lack of tension.\", 'Oh Yeah, Love this item, sleek looking and very easy to maintain, would definitely buy again for next strap, thank you Jim Dunlop.', \"What's great about the Dunlop design:\\n\\nThey work!  The only thing you need to do is ensure you've got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i.e. just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear-end off without worry.\\n\\nThe design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around/rotate on the post, which is exactly what you want.  The schaller ones (see below) have a major flaw in them from my family's experience.  We will never run anything other than this design going forward.\\n\\nWhat doesn't work with the Schaller Design:\\n\\nOur family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using Shaller-style locks for a while now.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend. The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.\\n\\nWe tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.\", 'I hate spending 13 bucks on a couple little pieces of hardware that probably cost 13 cents to make, but its better than the 20 bucks local music shops want for this same set.

It would have been nice if the instructions had suggested easier tools for getting on the retaining clip.\\n\\nThere are a couple issues I have encountered. I have found that straplocks extend out just enough to stop my guitar and bass from fitting in the case. Of course that's easily remedied by taking of the strap (which is best to do anyways before packing up), but it's just one more step that can be annoying if you're in a hurry to pack up or get started. Also, I've found that they sometimes rattle a bit when used on my acoustic bass.

It would not seat properly and would slide out. I had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side, where it worked, but now the switch is \"down there\". I don\\'t think Planet Waves is the first connector that I had a problem with that so I don\\'t blame them, but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure.

I\\'ve used cables with the G&H quiet plug (which also works well), but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the G&H- you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument.

The screws that are used to attach the Straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty large--there\\'s little chance that these are going to come out.  The locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance.  The only disadvantage of the Dunlop system to Schaller\\'s system is that the the Dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitar\\'s body.  Ordinarily, it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences.  On an instrument such as a Hofner \"violin\" bass, though, or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument, this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support.  Schaller\\'s strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players.  The Dunlop Straplok System is sturdy, should provide a long life of service, and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors.  Recommended for most guitar body styles', \"These harps are constantly breaking on me but I keep on buying them because they sound great while they last. I guess I'm bending too hard and the reeds are blowing out. Their cheap enough for me to just keep on buying a new one when they break.

But I use this cable in conjunction with my Boss TU-2 pedal to kill my signal.  When I play live, I usually bring a few guitars along with me.  Different songs call for different sounds, right?  So in the middle of my set, I might switch guitars.  Although I give warning to my live sound engineers that I'll be doing this throughout the set with signal killing switches in place, this still freaks them out when I unplug my cable.  It's kind of funny to watch them freak out in the back of the club and pull my fader all the way down.  The sad part is that they never put me back up to where I was, so my guitar ends up being much quieter than the rest of the band.\\n\\nOther than that, this cable sounds great.  I've been using them for nearly 8 years and not one has failed me yet.  I couldn't recommend them more for your amp -> instrument or pedal -> instrument cable.  You won't need this for any other patch other than to the instrument.  Don't get one if you need a cable that goes from your amp to your pedal board.  That'd be pointless.\", \"First and foremost, this is a high quality instrument cable, well built, with good sound (as near as I can tell), and it carries a lifetime guarantee.  You aren't sacrificing any quality or durability (remember the guarantee) to get the switch.  The switch itself functions perfectly.  There is only a switch on the instrument end of the cable (of course).  It sticks out further when in the off position, so you can tell by feel if it's on or off.  My experience so far is that it is completely noiseless to turn it on and off.\\n\\nI am a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, mandolin and banjo.

When used on these types of guitars, the \"unlocking stem\" of a Schaller can poke you in the stomach and be very uncomfortable.  For this reason, I decided to experiment with the Jim Dunlop design.\\n\\nI bought two sets of these to go on my hollow-body arch-tops.  I do agree with some reviewers that the metals feel a little flimsy and weak, and the overall feel when installed doesn\\'t feel as \"tight\" as the Schallers.  That said, the installation for both of my guitars was quick and flawless, and required no tools other than a screwdriver.  Another reviewer said his #2 driver would not fit, I did not have this problem.\\n\\nDespite my previous remarks on the quality of the metals and such, these locks have performed very nicely.  They haven\\'t failed yet, and if they ever do, I will be quickly returning here to amend my review.\\n\\nOne reviewer commented that the gold and/or silver sets could make your axe look gaudy.  I can agree with that potential.  I bought my Dunlop locks in black, so their appearance is barely noticeable to me against the black leather end of a guitar strap.\\n\\nIn closing, I would say that I am happy with this product, and give it a 5 star rating, but I still prefer the Schaller brand locking system.  The Schallers require a couple extra tools to install, and cost about $5 more, but I feel it is money well spent.  I will, however, most likely buy a few more sets of these Dunlops for my acoustics and my Viper, as I do prefer the comfort that these provide on those \\'back-mounted\\' strap button type guitars.\\n\\nHope this is helpful to someone.  Thank you for reading.', 'I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:\\n\\n1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.\\n\\n2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.\\n\\n3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.\\n\\nRealistically, if the screws weren\\'t total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won\\'t fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here\\'s what I recommend:\\n\\nGo to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1\" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won\\'t fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)\\n\\nPut the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn\\'t need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.\\n\\nInstall with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!', \"Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big. They stand out too much. They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap.  Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play. Not cool.\", \"About 4 years ago,  one of my friend dropped his bass and its body broke in half. that bass had regualr strap button, ever since then he use this dunlop straplok system. i recently built a bass myself and i install this one. it's very easy to install, very straight forward to use it. it holds my jazz bass without any problem. i would buy this from now on for all my electic guitars.\", \"they work well.

I thought (and this has been mentioned by others) that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument, which I thought looked goofy.  I also didn't particularly care for the push button release, and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a C clamp, not a nut, so there's no allowance for differing thickness. I also felt safer with the Schallers, which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn't depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together.  As I said, I had no real problems with them, so if they look like they'd work for you, great.

The stick tips provide good rebound and are excellent on cymbals.\\n\\nBesides using these in a playing situation I also use them to tame down new cymbals. This jazz cymbals are usually wild, trashy when brand new and I like to settle mine in before I use them. Normally that require play-in time. If you want to hasten the play-in process, mallet rolls is a common trick many of us use. This entails taking a pair of these mallets and rolling them around the cymbal for 20 minutes per day for a week or so. Start at the outside edge and work your way towards the bell, going around the circumference of the cymbal.\\n\\nBottom line: it\\'s prudent to have a pair of mallets in your stick bag so that you are prepared for any musical situation.

The red LED light is great for confirming channel switching and there is a polarity switch to ensure that the light comes on for the appropriate channel.  In the case of my AC-60 I use it to signal that the amp is audible (mute is off).  It uses two AA batteries to power it (the newer model uses 2 AAA batteries).  The batteries last a long time, but I have noticed that when they run low the switch begins to respond intermittently.  The pedal is designed to interlock with other FS series pedals, such as the FS-5U, which helps with the AC-60 because the effect switching uses an unlatched switch.  The downside to this switch is the price and the sharp aluminum corners. If you put this in your gig bag it will be torn to shreds.

Wood comb makes it a mustash hanger and being nailed together makes it hard to service for adjustment and cleaning. BUT! if you ike this kind of harmonica the Folkmaster is just as good for 1/2 the price.', '----------Hohner Marine Band 1896 Classic:\\n-(***__) Overall: The longtime favorite of many players, undisputed best for decades and, in my opinion, still a fantastic wood-comb harmonica at the mid-price range. Many pros still use it, though often custom versions (which any of us can easily buy, at a cost). The Marine Band has an amazing sound, but the reason I did not rate it higher is there are other harmonicas I prefer in terms of comfort and playability (full comparison and ranking below). My favorite wood-comb harmonica is the Marine Band Crossover, which is simply an upgraded version of the Marine Band 1896 classic. If you are a beginner I strongly recommend the Hohner Special 20 (plastic comb) for its ease of play. If you are willing to spend more I recommend the Suzuki Promaster (metal comb), which is my favorite off-the-shelf harmonica.\\n-(*****) Sound: Excellent. This harmonica feels warm and deep. It is as good as my favorite: the Marine Band Crossover. However variations in sound quality between harmonicas are slight and likely to be lost on an audience. I\\'d much rather focus on getting a comfortable harmonica.\\n-(**___) Comfort: Wood-comb harmonicas just never seem to be as comfortable as plastic-comb ones. The Marine Band is not the worst I have experienced, but the coverplates do stick out over the wood comb slightly. This means the lips press and slide against two sharp pieces of metal, which is uncomfortable. The Special 20 (plastic comb) and Suzuki Promaster (metal comb) are significantly more comfortable.\\n-(***__) Playability: The protruding coverplates make it harder to get a tight seal and are an issue. I didn\\'t have excessive gapping issues with any individual reeds or any being excessively out of tune. I didn\\'t have issues with reeds getting \"stuck\", which is unusual at this price range.\\n-(**___) Durability: Durability is the weakness of Hohner overall. With wood-combs you add the additional issue that the comb can/will warp over time.\\n-(**___ Aesthetics): Very standard classic look, but the yellow coating on the wood is unattractive. I give it two stars instead of three because I much prefer the natural look of the Marine Band Crossover\\'s wood comb. The carrying case is hard plastic and will break eventually, not as nice as the crossover\\'s zippable pouch.\\n\\n-----------Qualitative Comparison with other mid-price Harmonicas (lowest to highest score)\\n---(**___) Hohner Blues Harp: This is the harmonica I own that I don\\'t enjoy playing. The redeeming quality is the Blues Harp sounds very good, enough to compete with any harmonica in its price range. However the metal covers protrude and are sharp on the lips, making it simply too uncomfortable to be any good. The Marine Band is more comfortable (covers protrude less).\\n---(**___) Hohner Big River: Nothing memorable. It\\'s perfectly fine but there\\'s no reason to buy it over the Special 20(the $ savings is minimal). Unlike the Special 20 it has a wood comb, but if you want a wood comb buy a Marine Band.\\n---(***__) Seydel 1847 Silver (plastic comb) and Noble (metal comb): Seydel 1847 and its distinctive steel reeds is the company\\'s flagship and a harmonica I find very polarizing. positive is that the coverplates form an uniquely thin opening for the mouth which makes it extremely easy to play. The downside is my Seydel 1847\\'s are my only harmonicas that sound undeniably unpleasant. Both harmonicas have a distinctly metallic tinny sound, which is probably due to the steel reeds, and explains why steel is not a common choice for reed material. Comfortable harmonica with tinny sound; overall not recommended.\\n---(****_) Suzuki Pureharp: Having both coverplates and the comb made out of rosewood makes the Pureharp perhaps the most attractive harmonica available and theone with the warmest and most enjoyable sound. It is surprisingly easy to play, though the wood coverplates slide less smoothly and require more saliva. Not recommended for a fast song. Too unique to be a first harmonica, it is great for a player looking to expand their collection with a harmonica that has a great warm tone.\\n---(****_) Lee Oskar Major Diatonic: Excellent harmonica, extremely comfortable, great sound. It is extremely similar to the Special 20. It has a good reputation for durability, and my experience is that it outlasts the Special 20. One downside is the plastic case can break within a month from normal daily opening/closing. Ultimately I prefer the Special 20: The Lee Oskar feels slightly thicker on the lips because of the way the coverplates are rounded, which I don\\'t like\\n---(****_) Suzuki Firebreath: Excellent harmonica but poor value for the high price tag. In true Suzuki style, this black beauty and its rosewood comb look stunning. The sound is awesome and distinct: it is very soothing and my absolute favorite for slower melodies. The Firebreath is comfortable for a wood-comb harmonica; no sharp angles. The drawback is I find it difficult to get a tight seal on this harmonica and therefore can\\'t comfortably play blues or other fast music. This is my favorite high-quality harmonica for slow songs, but I do not find it versatile and would not recommend it as a first/main harmonica or as a blues harmonica.\\n---(*****) Hohner Marine Band Crossover: My favorite wood-comb harmonica. This is an upgraded version of the Marine Band 1896 Classic. The nails that hold shut the 1896 have been replaced with screws that permit cleaning and replacing the reeds, the comb\\'s yellow finish has been replaced with a smooth clear finish which keeps the natural color of the wood and looks much better. It comes with a great zippable case, which is the best of any harmonica. The Crossover maintains the great tone of a Marine Band, producing a great wood comb harmonica.\\n--(*****) Hohner Special 20: My favorite Plastic Comb Harmonica, and outstanding in terms of comfort and ease of play. The plastic comb protrudes, making it extremely comfortable and smooth to use. The sound is great. Durability is terrible. The case is more durable than the Lee Oskar one but not as nice as the (excellent) pouch that comes with the Marine Band Crossover.\\n---(*****) Suzuki Promaster Valved: This metal-comb harmonica is my favorite off-the-shelf harmonica. It hits all the marks with a great sound and a particularly outstanding playability. The surface is smooth and comfortable on the lips and allows for a tight seal and easy playability. The harmonica is shiny and sleek looking, and comes with a good quality plastic case with rounded corners that make it comfortable in the pockets. If I could only own one off-the-shelf harmonica I would own this one.\\n\\n---------- Custom Harmonica:\\n--(*****) Antony Dannecker Optimus: Simply the best harmonica I have played, but comes at a price. Antony is great and very available if you want to discuss any particular tweaks to your custom harmonica. This very heavy harmonica is objectively the easiest to play out of the many I own. I literally stopped to smile the first time I tried it. We can debate forever if it\\'s actually worth the high price, maybe it isn\\'t. What\\'s certain is that a great harmonica is not enough to make you a great player but also that off-the-shelf quality can\\'t compete with the Optimus.\\n\\n----------Note on the 2-draw:\\n1-2-star reviews often complain their 2-draw was broken from day one. The 2-draw most likely is not broken, it is simply a very difficult note for beginners to play.\\n\\n----------Note on which key to buy first:\\n--Start with a key of C.\\nThis is the accepted standard since most beginner songs and lessons will all be in C. One harmonica is fine as a beginner.\\n--Then: A, D, G\\nA is common in blues and country. D is also common. G is often used when playing along with guitar.\\n--Then Bb, F, E,... here is gets more debatable\\n\\n---------- If any edit would improve the review quality/thoroughness/clarity write me a comment.', \"Versatile delay with plenty of starter parameters and memory locations.

If the wheels were more like suitcase wheels (you know the kind that are rollerblade wheels that are inset to the case a bit) it would have worked for me, but since the wheels sit completely out, it didn't fit.  I'm very sad having to return it.  One more thing you shoudl know about the case.  The YPT-300 weighs next to nothing, but this case adds on a bit of weight,  I don't know for certain how much but I'd say between 15-20 lbs total.

The unit is great.  There are a number of presets that more than covered my needs and for each preset you can customize your sound giving you virtually unlimited options for delay.  There are 4 buttons, 3 of which can be used to store either presets or customized settings.  You can switch between the settings on the fly with ease and not degradation in sound.  The lone drawback, but for me not enough to dissuade me from the unit, is that the 4th button offers a short loop option, but Ive never used this as I have a separate looper.', \"I'm not s big fan of pedals.

Despite my preconceived notions about Marine Bands, I've found that I really like them.  Nice bright sound, relatively easy to play (although it does require a little more air than, say, a Lee Oskar), and notes play well consistently.  Plus, this harp has a special place in harmonica history, being one of the oldest harps currently made and one of the most popular harmonicas of all time.  I'd recommend this, both to beginners and more experienced players.\", \"The Marine Band has to be without a doubt the most responsive harmonica I own.  The minute you blow into it the notes effortlessly fly out of it; like running water or a knife going through butter.  The Marine Band really cuts through the mix of other instruments in ways that I have not seen other harps do.  The tone is great!  It speaks with an amazing clarity and has a rich and beautiful timbre that is tight and incredibly focused, yet lush and warm at the same.  It is much brighter than the Hohner Blues Harp Overall the Marine Band is a very musically versatile instrument.  It will do what you tell it to. If you want to play screaming solos, rock, cry the blues, folk, make your harmonica sing or if you are nuts about tone, this is the harp for you. The Marine Band is ideal for single note playing (you do have to pucker more than you would with bigger harps like Lee Oskar). Additionally, it is comfortable and smooth on the lips, and the comb is sealed off a lot better than the Blues harp.  It's easy to hold and it fits perfectly in the Hohner neck rack (if you are a guitar player like me) without moving around.  This harp delivers the sound that I hear in my head without fear of being held back in my musical ideas because of poor construction.  Do yourself a favor and buy one, you will be amazed at what you hear coming out of this little harp.  Thanks Hohner for a great product!\", 'This is a good sounding harmonica but I have to take away a star for it\\'s shoddy construction and by that I mean the areas around the blowholes. The 2 brass plates that are sandwiched between the chrome outer plates both had a very pronounced sharp edge that I had to file down to keep from cutting my lips.  Yes folks, they were very sharp!\\nI expect this out of a cheapie Chinese made harp but this harp has \"Made in Germany\" stamped on it and it cost me over $30!  All of my life I have associated German made goods to be of the highest quality in the world. This is inexcusable!  The Lee Oskar harps I own have a smooth edge...and they are made in Japan!\\nAside from all of that this is a good sounding harmonica', \"I did not purchase this case through Amazon, but must comment on how awesome Gator customer service is.  I purchased the case for my Korg Kronos 88.  I owned the case for 4 years when the zipper broke.

The tone is very complementing to my desire for pristine cleans(as it does not break cause a lot of break up) and I love having the option of the tap tempo and 15 varieties of delays from vintage to modern. I returned the Boss DD20 which for me left a lot to be desired (due to its very flat sounds--many of the tones where indiscernible), for this wonder green pedal and so far I am quite satisfied.  I noticed on the feed back that everyone loves the loop option--a very stunning feature!\\nAnother issue that caught my attention was the controversy of this pedal is the charging requirements:12vAC (which is hard to get if you are running an all DC power brick).  Many individuals say that they hate using the power supply or C batteries, well my answer to them is either 1) by the charger or 2) get a T-rex Chameleon fuel tank, (which has a 12vAC option and a special cable, designated for the Line 6 DL4 and many other Line 6 models. I know this is an expensive option but the T-rex chameleon fuel tank is very useful piece of equipment that will power most all of your effects which means you can kiss those boxes of batteries goodbye.  It also helps kill the very annoying buzz that ensues when too many units are running at the same time through your signal).\\nThe price is a bit steep but if you are like me--an individual after that tone that says \"this is me,\" then don\\'t be scared of the price tag!\\n\\np.s. I realize that I went off on a T-Rex chameleon tangent for a good half of this review, just passionate about both devices.', \"When you have a DL4, the idea of having a delay pedal that does one kind of effect seems just silly.  If you want to use delay, you want this pedal.  It has the standard digital and (modeled) analog delays, but also has unique delays like reverse, ping-pong, delayed swell, rotary horn, etc, plus the loop sampler, which is its most famous feature.  Now let me say this . . . if you are after a loop station first and foremost, don't get this--look into one of Boss's stations; but the fact that a loop sampler is included among a long list of other great functions is a great selling point.  I play through an multi-effects unit that includes most of the delay options in this pedal, but I use this primarily since its usability is so great.\", 'The Nady MPF-6 6\" Clamp Microphone Pop Filter works great with Behringer C3 Condenser Microphone and the on Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand.

At under twenty dollars you won't find many competitors, especially with this build quality. It is essentially an embroidery hoop with black pantyhose, an adjustable arm and screw clamp. Building one yourself will probably run you over twenty dollars and you will end up with an interesting mixture of distracting textures and colors, so why not just buy it instead? Functionally it works fine. It does muffle sound to some extent when stacked up against a metal mesh screen but for anything short of an audience of 50,000, it should appease just fine. all in all, if you are hitting annoying pops in your recording and don't want to spend a lot of money -- this is the way to go.\", \"This case has been a blessing for me.

I never had anything other than SKB hard cases, however they were too heavy for local gigging so I went through a few Yamaha Motif ES6 bags which Yamaha doesn't make anymore.

Out of the box it comes with strings already installed and it\\'s even nearly in tune. It appears to be already adjusted for intonation or at least close to it. Even though the included strings sound alright, I will probably be changing them soon to Ernie Balls because they feel a bit rough on the fingers and I prefer the slick feeling of regular slinkys.\\n\\nMy only complaint with this guitar is that my \"Killpot\" feature doesn\\'t appear to be working. This SG Special is suppose to be equipped with a tone knob that pushes in like a button. While you\\'re holding the tone knob down the signal is suppose to be cut to complete silence. However, when I press mine I can feel it click in and out, but absolutely nothing happens. I\\'ve pressed it, tapped it, held it down, pumped it, it doesn\\'t do a damn thing! It\\'s a shame because I really liked the idea of cutting the volume without having to roll the volume pot down.\\n\\nHave you experienced this with your Epiphone as well? I\\'d love to hear a solution.\\nI\\'ll attach some photos of my new SG Special, as well as a comparison to my Fender.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I\\'d love to see your comments and helpful votes!', 'Oh the sound this makes!!

It has held up perfectly and I am really happy with it.  I would immediately buy it again if I lost it... which would have to happen because it will never break!\\n\\nUpdate #2- It's June 2010 and I use this Daily...for real. They are both (6 &12) my only capos and they are fantastic. To let you know, my 12 string I use a capo fulltime on the first fret since I tune it down to relieve string tension on the 12. So I just love these capos and they most likely will last forever.\\n\\nUpdate #3- It's July 2011 and I still have both of them.  I have forgotten they are on there for days at a time and they still show no permanent gouges.  I use these as part of my daily playing experience. Awesome product!\", \"If you own a 12-string guitar, you already know you need a longer capo for anything below the fifth fret. This capo is longer, beefier, and with a stronger spring than its 6-string brother.\\n\\nAnother less obvious benefit is the stronger spring makes it work better that the smaller 6-string capo. For the sake of intonation and pitch, I capo as close to the fret as possible. When capoing VERY close to, or on top of the fret using the 6-string capo, the smaller (higher pitched) low E string would sometimes buzz because is was not being pressed firmly on the fret (because its big fat twin was keeping the rubber of the capo too far above the fret). The stronger spring of this 12-string model forces both strings firmly against the fret, so there is no buzzing, even when capoing right on the fret.\\n\\nYou won't regret the purchase.\", '888\\n\\nMy guitar fits perfectly in this case!

The product in itself is quite good! Finish is good its got good padding on the sides. Two padded straps to protect your keyboard. However it is way bigger for a 61 key keyboard ( i have a fantom x6).\\nAlso i don't think it will survive air travel or extensive touring.\\nHowever the major pain point for me was the weight - its listed at 8.8 pounds on the amazon website - however it felt more like 15 pounds (heavier than my SKB 4214W) - so i checked the product packaging - it says the net weight as 8 KILOS and gross as 10 kg. So there is definitely an error from amazon's end.\\nAs a result i am compelled to return this otherwise good product (though it doesn't compare to flight cases or SKB 4214W like molded plastic cases).\\nP.S. - interior has lot of empty space - if you think the padding will protect from impacts due to gravity, - then definitely i think it should be less than 1 meter or so (just a speculation).

I've been playing for 30 years and own about a dozen electric guitars of various makes across a wide range of prices. I wanted to get an SG to play some classic rock and have fun with. I didn't expect much for the price, but I tried this guitar and the G400 Pro and honestly preferred the feel of this one.\\n\\nThe guitar came boxed with an inner box to protect it during shipping. Although playability out of the box was fairly good, I had to perform a setup to get the guitar exactly as I wanted. I removed the strings, rubbed down and oiled the fingerboard, then strung it with D'Addario 10-46 nickel wounds. The truss rod required a quarter turn adjustment to get the neck profile straight. The intonation and action were pretty much perfect out of the box. I just raised the action a tiny bit to make it more in line with my other instruments.\\n\\nThe pickups are a bit darker than a traditional SG and while they sound great heavily overdriven, the clean sound is a bit lacking in character. After a week or so of playing, I replaced the pickups with a set I bought from Amazon:\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009A5JA98/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\nThese pickups are amazing value for money and sound fabulous. However the pickup frame was larger than the original stock pickups so I had to rout the body slightly to get the new pickups to fit. This was a simple operation which only took me 10 minutes to do with the Dremel.\\n\\nAfter a bit of work, this guitar now looks, plays and sounds like a professional instrument. It's rapidly becoming my favorite guitar to jam with. I love it!\", \"All I can say is but this guitar, it's worth it.\", \"Bought for my Nord Stage 2.

I've taken this case over smooth and rough terrain and I have no worries about damaging them or the keyboard inside.\\n- Lots of pockets, including many sealed with zippers and Velcro.\\n- Heavily padded interior with a simple but effective strapping system\\n\\nCons:\\n- The top is NOT rigid, so don't expect to be stacking a whole bunch of stuff on top of it.  It also makes things awkward when you've got a lot of stuff in the pouch while you're trying to open/close the case.\\n- Not enough handles on the outside!  Anything beyond wheeling it around becomes a 2-man job or a very awkward 1-man job.  Just having a handle on both sides of the case would have been magnificent.  This is a real downer for me since I'm usually hauling my stuff solo.\\n- Could have benefited from arm strap(s).  This thing gets really freaking heavy when fully loaded and an arm strap could have really helped.\\n- Top handle doesn't extend far enough.  You end up holding the case away from you a bit while wheeling because the top of the case hits your legs/waist while you're walking around.  Better than having no wheels for sure, but those long treks get uncomfortable holding it with your arm at a 35-degree angle.\\n\\nOverall, it's a good case despite the number of cons as it delivers on the most important requirements.

I bought two of them for my Epiphone Les Paul and the Slash kit guitar.  The case will be worth the money, so your guitar is protected.', 'I bought two of these cases from Guitar Center and another Epi case for my ES339 from Amazon.  The first LP case came with a number of the bumps under the vinyl that other reviewers have mentioned.  Some were quite pointy.  I have a Quality Systems background in manufacturing and I will say there is no excuse for a manufacturing process producing cases with these types of defects.  Pointy anomalies under vinyl may eventually compromise the vinyl and lead to punctures.\\n\\nAn even bigger problem with the first LP case happened when the vinyl started to delaminate from the body at one of the bends in the case.  The delamination was about 4 inches in length.  It looked like a poor glue curing issue.\\n\\nThe second LP case arrived yesterday without the bumps and so far no delamination.  However it had a number of areas where there have clearly been repairs to cuts in the vinyl.  Again noticeable repairs should be sold as second class products off price and not first class.\\n\\nThe ES339 case also arrived yesterday from Amazon Warehouse and on the outside it looks much better than either of the two LP cases.  It was listed as \"acceptable\" and was off price so it\\'s a real bargain.\\n\\nIn all three cases the insides are plushly lined and fit the guitar they are designed for like a glove.  They offer solid neck support especially for a guitar with a bent headstock unlike a Fender.\\n\\nIMO, the soft outside vinyl will cut easily over time as it is very soft and pliable.  The shell itself and the inside of the case will protect your guitar very well.  So if you don\\'t mind a \"well traveled\" look on the outside in a relatively short period of time, I recommend the case.\\n\\nNow the hardware:  for a case that has a guitar makers name on it and costs over $100 I expect the hardware and rivets to be first class.  My Fender Strat Pro case is like that and it costs around the same price.  The Epi case IMO uses cheap clasps and the rivets look to be on the lighter gauge side.  I hope they will stand up over time but I shouldn\\'t have to hope.\\n\\nBottom line:  two of my five guitars are Epis.  The quality on both are fantastic in terms of fit, finish, set up, etc.. especially for overseas produced guitars.  BUT...the Epi cases at least in my experience and other reviews here leave something to be desired.  Obviously the cases come from another supplier outsourced by Epiphone.  My advice is to get their quality systems under control or find a new supplier.  The cases do not do justice to the Epi name.', 'This case is beautiful!

All of this started as my daughter got me my 1st guitar for Christmas 2016.\\n\\nI believe some of the reviews of damaged cases could be due to the carriers...they need to be handled with care when they are in transit.

Admittedly, it's going to get scuffed up and a bump isn't going to matter, but new out of the box, it wasn't what I wanted to see. A second issue relates to the latches; three of the four have a good firm latch, but the fourth is almost too loose to close properly - this is without a guitar inside the case.\\n\\nThe case also has a very strong 'plastic' odor in the interior. Not a big issue I guess as guitars don't really pick up odors, but it doesn't dissipate quickly. Even when left to air (open) for 24 hours, the odor was still very strong.\\n\\nReading through a few other reviews of this product I noted a 'bump' issue similar to the one to this case.

I only wish I could have found fitted cases like this for my Stratocasters & Telecaster. This is just a terrific case. When I first opened it I immediately noticed that there was no strong 'new case' odor. (I usually air out a new case for a day or two before putting my guitar in it. There was no need to with this case.) I really appreciate the 'safety latch' on the opposite side from where you open it, this looks like added protection from the case inadvertently flying open. The case also has a locking latch for security, however please note that it only comes with one key - another key would be nice, just in case (no pun intended). A nice touch is the very large, well-cushioned carrying handle which allows you to maintain a comfortable grip. The metal feet on the back & the bottom of the case are also appreciated - You can actually stand the case up on the floor without leaning it on something due to the feet on the bottom (I'd be worried a pet might bump it an knock it over though). As stated, the interior is very well padded, and it features a wonderful covered compartment in which to carry accessories such as picks, a tuner, a strap or an instrument cable etc.\\nI really like the fact that because it is made for a specific model guitar, the Epiphone Les Paul case is no bigger than it has to be. You'll be surprised at how compact it is. Not only will this easily fit in the 'way back' of my SUV, but it will also easily fit in my convertible which I can't say for my large ABS cases that I keep my Telecaster & Stratocasters in. Granted the large ABS cases have lots of bins for storage inside, they are also heavy & more difficult to carry around, where this case is much easier to carry & has enough storage for just what you need to take along with your Les Paul Guitar.\\nFor the price paid I wasn't expecting such a nice guitar case.

Most guitars that I\\'ve seen are like this, but it wasn\\'t the case for the takamine.\\n\\nOn the guitars that it worked with, and compared with my previous capos which require the user to screw the capo clamp tighter/looser for each fret, there are definite pros and cons..\\nPros:\\n-The capo is extremely easy to move from one fret to the next and to remove.\\n-The capo is faster at moving from one fret to the next. The other capos required tension changes really for any different fret, which means valuable time during a performance of you simply tightening a screw a little bit to get the perfect tightness.\\n-The capo just looks better. Its design looks top notch.\\n\\nCons:\\n-The capo is a little less versatile. By this I mean that you don\\'t have much \"control\" over it. Its tension is always the same. I did not feel comfortable going to higher frets when I thought of just how tightly it was squeezing the guitar neck (and it wouldn\\'t go past fret 12 on my seagull due to size limitations). Additionally, I\\'ll experiment with partial capo songs that my twist capos would be able to configure to but not this. (Not a huge deal).\\n-You do have to be careful if you want good intonation. The twist capos come straight down when clamping shut, compared to this which can come in angled. The result is that the strings get bent or pushed to one side and always end up sharp. You have to be careful. (That being said, once in position, I\\'ve noticed it holds the intonation better after longer periods of time).\\n\\nAfter awhile it becomes easier to not mess up the intonation, and there are very few times when I\\'m performing that I have to do anything fancy with a guitar capo, which really only leaves the pros. I\\'d say it\\'s important though to have a few capos on hand for the different uses, but this is one that should be at close reach.

We have been producing professional instructional videos for several years (some are available on Amazon)for my wife\\'s business, but we recently decided to offer our services to local businesses as well. That required us to put a little more effort into making our studio area more professional looking for clients, which meant replacing the double thickness of stocking stretched over a wire coat-hanger form we had been using as a Pop Filter.\\n\\nIt works very well for attenuating the sharper \"P\", \"T\", and \"S\" sounds that cause spikes when doing voice-overs.

The flexible metal pipe allows the filter to be moved to the optimum position.\\n\\nIssues: The clamp doesn\\'t hold as tightly as it should to the microphone stand. The metal pipe is somewhat difficult to maneuver. Neither issue is a show stopper, only something to keep in mind.', \"Yes, you can make your own pop filter at home, but you don't want to.  Why else would you be reading this?  Besides, it won't look this good.\\n\\nI've purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months.  The most recent one I purchased was NOT this one.  I wish it was.  I thought I'd try something different, just to see the differences.  Well, I can tell you that there are significant differences between this, and some of the others featured here.\\n\\nThe bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to.  The competitors that I've tried do not.  If you do not have this rubber piece, any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly.  This is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible.  Fortunately, Nady placed this rubber piece on it's clamp so this has never been an issue.\\n\\nThe only complaint I have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times.  A single dot of superglue fixed that.\\n\\nCompared to the other pop filters I've seen and used, this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you can't beat it.\\n\\nAnd yes, pop filters ARE A MUST with condenser microphones.

Back and forth from home to rehearsal.  Nothing fancy.  A few days ago though, I took a nasty fall.  I had my instrument and this folder in one hand and a backpack in the other, so there was no way of stopping myself from hitting the ground hard.  I tried to toss the stuff on my way down and get that arm under myself but wasn't fast enough.  Even so, I let the folder and instrument go from about two feet; they flew a good six or seven feet before hitting the rocky ground and sliding another foot or so.  The instrument (in its case) landed on top of the folder.  When I got up and collected everything, nothing except me was broken.  Just muddy.  A wet paper towel took care of that, and this folder is still looking like it's brand new.  It even stayed shut and kept my music from flying all over the field.  It is a trooper.\\n\\nUPDATE:  I've had this for just over a year now and I've been using it for two bands.  It's been stuffed to the gills with sheet music to the point where it's almost too heavy for my cheap old music stand, and I open/close it daily.  It still looks brand new, and the elastic bands are still in perfect shape.  They haven't frayed or snapped yet.

Either folder is sufficiently large for any band music in our band\\'s huge library.\\n\\nFor use by an individual, the padding is a nice touch.  However, if used by a large band in volume, the extra 1/4\" thickness per folder could be a storage issue if folders are stored centrally.

I saw this, and figured I'd get it instead. BOSS is supposedly only releasing them this year. I believe there was a VERY limited run of these in a black-sparkle finish, but these are just the black ones.\\n\\nIt's the same sound as the original orange DS-1; that classic solid-state distortion that's a little noisy, heavier than the SD-1 or those Tube Screamer type pedals. It can push overdriven amps quite well, though with more gain than an average overdrive pedal, and can stack with overdrive pedals. Great pedal if you're looking for that punk-meets-noise/college rock kinda sound from the 90's. Basically the 2 effects pedals that were popular for 90's rock were this, or the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi (NYC). I'm trying not to say it nails that grunge sound like every other reviewer on here, and doing a quite good job.\\n\\nThe main difference in this and the original DS-1 that's on the market is this one is black and orange with black and gold knobs instead of orange and black with regular knobs, and it's built in Japan instead of Taiwan. The made-in-Japan factor might make it a better value for most.\\n\\nBasically, I collect pedals, and thought this one would be a fun addition to my collection. It's very nostalgic  (as stated in my DS-1 review on here). Definitely a fine distortion for a good price. It won't knock my BE-OD off of my board, but it's still a fun pedal to have around. In all seriousness though, if you're just looking for a DS-1 pedal for it's sound, I'd consider the standard orange DS-1; also a great pedal for a little less money.\\n\\nEdit: This pedal is actually made in Taiwan. My bad.\", 'Been building up my pedal collection, and came across one of these at a great price. I know they\\'ve been around for decades, and I have played them before, but I was never really a BOSS fan.\\n\\nSo yeah, this is the iconic BOSS Distortion pedal, the one beginners gravitate towards because it\\'s unmistakably a distortion pedal... it says so right  on the pedal. Soundwise, it\\'s like the heavier brother of the SD-1. It doesn\\'t do a clean boost; there\\'s drive going even if the \"DRIVE\" knob is turned all the way down. In general, this pedal makes me think 90\\'s grunge, like a Sonic Youth or some other band from Seattle that was big in the early 90\\'s.\\n\\nThe sound is really it\\'s own thing; not a Marshall-in-a-box, more like a transistor distortion should sound. It doesn\\'t really make a solid-state amp sound like a tube amp, it\\'s just a very honest distortion. The price is fair for what the pedal is.\\n\\nDefinitely worth the price of admission, and they hold their resale value quite well.', \"Great pedal, the gold standard of 90's distortion.

So I don't shell out a lot of money for high-end equipment.  That being said, I love this guitar.  The tuners work well with virtually no slip.  The action and feel is really nice (you'll undoubtedly need to get it adjusted when you first get it), and the sound on it is pretty bass-heavy, meaning it would probably do well for metal styles.  The pickups are nothing to write home about, which if you're a more experience guitarist, you'll probably swap these out right away - the stock stuff is fairly boring and average.  I get a decent amount of sustain off of this instrument, which is a definate plus.  Compared to some other guitars that I've played, this thing is built like a tank, and a bit awkward to manuver with if in an enclosed space.  The headstock feels perticularly cumbersome, and (again) can make things difficuly when you're moving around in tight quarters.  But none of that has any real bearing on the guitar overall.  But is does feel like you've slung a beast over your shoulders.\\n\\nThe only downside that I can find with this guitar is how the neck is fastened to the body.  If you're used to hammering away on your guitar, you'll never get a single note in tune - there seemes to be a tiny amount of play in the neck that affects intonation.  If you have a lighter touch, no problems.  So, you're not going to want to be jumping around on stage with this thing wrapped around you...aside from the fact that doing so may actually maim or kill one of your bandmates because of its bulk.\\n\\nAll in all it is a good beginner to intermediate guitar.

Like the SD-1 you have to use it properly.  We used these in the 80's in front of JCM 800's.  The early JCM's at max gain and club gig volume were very crunchy, no insane gain on their own, and the DS-1 pushed it to high gain.  That's how you use these classic pedals . Same with the SD-1 you used it to push crunchy tube amps.  The SD-1 had a softer clip  and the DS-1 has a very hard edge to it. Don't buy these to play on a clean channel or even worse on a Solid State amp.  These are for pushing tube amps over the edge and they do it well.\", \"Although I did not buy this product an amazon, I wanted to do a review when i found out that it was still available to date.

I use the orange micro dark as clean as I can get it, and set the volume and shape knobs accordingly. My entire rhythm sound is this pedal, and it is amazing! I play a lot of heavy metal, (Metallica, MegadetH, Slayer, trivium, bullet for my valentine, etc) and also 80's heavy metal and classic rock, (poison, skid row, whitesnake, quiet riot, def leopard, etc) and this Pedal, with a little understand about sound and compression, makes everything sound massive! A lot of people complaining about the pedal simply are using it wrong, or just genuinely don't like it, but the majority use it wrong. If you dime the gain, you get an unsettling amount of compression. So I usually back it off until I hear the compression fade away. I set the tone know to the 11:00-11:30 position, depending on the pickups I use, and the level knob is Dependant on how loud my clean signal is. For rhythm, it's a beast, but for leads...

I've heard several complaints saying that it lacks diversity (from a bunch of snobs who only get pedals with 50 knobs), but I say thats a bunch of bologna. I can use this and turn up the tone to play a tone filled, dirty Mtley Cre song, and on the other side, I can turn it down and get a deep rumble and play some Black Sabbath and anywhere in between. If you're looking for a classic, mean distortion pedal, this is it. You cannot beat it for the price. Yeah, you might find something with a bit better diversity for $200, but why would you do that when pay $50 and get something with a sound just as good? For beginners, BOSS is cheap, and awesome.

Nearly everyone has owned one at some point or another.  Its cheap, simple to use and just fun to fool around with.  It feels like it's been around since the dawn of time, and there are lots of well-known artists that are known to use it.  There are literally TONS of mods out there for it, most all of them are probably real improvements because lets face it...it isn't that spectacular of a pedal in it's own right.  Yes, I have one on my pedal board, but I feel like it robs my squawky strat of bottom end too much (it may be more forgiving with humbucker pickups).  So really the only way I can tolerate the pedal is by putting my BOSS GE-7 after it to boost some of the low end again.  That being done, I find the EQ really cleans up the mess of a mediocre distortion pedal.  I've also been temped to mod it (the keeley mod for one is pretty popular, and public on the internet), as the pedal costs next to nothing, and really whats the worst that can happen?  Who knows, it really could be great!  After all, all those great artists that have one on their board, I suspect they've modded theirs too!\\n\\n3 stars.  A pedal with potential.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying it, but I think without an EQ or a mod, you might not have it very long.\", \"Some of the reviews I read are negative, which is surprising but, at the same time, something I do respect. IMHO, when it comes to sound there is nothing set on stone; it all comes down to personal taste.

This company is owned now by Roland, which is mainly known for their keyboard line. I don't see any compromise in quality, though, and the tone (which is the most important aspect of getting a guitar pedal), is top notch. Again, this is for my personal taste. If you like other pedals, it's great, but trashing this product just because you don't like it, it's kind of not fair.\\nI specifically wanted to add this particular DS-1 pedal to my pedal board because Joe Satriani and Tom Morello, two players I am into a lot lately, use them (or have used them in the past), and I am getting exactly what I was looking for.\\nIf there is one downside to pedals is the price.

I didn`t know why until I bought one and tried it the other day. It has a very rich and musical sounding distortion. I must say it`s a breath of fresh air in today`s world where the music is crap now. If you love classic rock from the 70`s turn the distortion to half-way and you will love this pedal. If you love 80`s hard rock or hair metal turn up the distortion anywhere from 3 quarters of the way up to max and you will love this pedal. Even If you love 90`s alternative rock turn up the distortion all the way and you will love this pedal and guitarists are still using it in 2014.

Enough Said', \"Ive been a punk rock and metal fan my life. Metal wise this pedal is pretty alright, but punk rock wise it's legendary.

It can literally do any sound you need. I kid you not, many people ask how I get \"that\" sound, and it\\'s this little box.  Set tone on 9 o\\'clock, gain at 3 o\\'clock and output to full, nice, creamy and very responsive. With a tube amp, your otherwise useless volume knob on your axe becomes a tone shaping tool.  Battery lasts for a very long time.\\nSo many guitarists used this pedal for their signature sound, for example Gary Moore.\\n\\nAs with most electronics made in China, something will start going wrong with this pedal after about 5 years.  Usually it\\'s a poor jack connection or the switch.  I just ordered another pedal because mine started turning itself off randomly, I\\'ve had mine for 5.5 years.  But regardless, it\\'s a cheap pedal, you can easily go buy another one.  On to Boss DS-1 #3!', 'This is a fun banjo/guitar.  It plays nicely.  Projects nicely too.  You can modify it with a pickup with relative ease.  I play guitar and had no interest in learning a new fingering technique for a banjo.  You can play it like a regular guitar, but it projects loudly enough that you can play it just by rubbing your fingers against the strings to get a sound.  It\\'s a nice breather when I\\'m burnt out on guitar.  It\\'s a different sound.  It\\'s comforting and relaxing.\\n\\nThe question that I think a lot of people who are considering this banjo is \"Do I have to buy the hardshell case Dean makes for it.\"\\n- The answer is \"NO\".\\n\\nI took a chance and purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Carrion-C-2901-Fretted-Resonator-Banjo-Case/dp/B001FB5Z4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Carrion C-2901 Fretted Resonator Banjo Case</a>&nbsp;(sold here on Amazon) and it fits my Dean Backwoods 6 Banjo perfectly.  It\\'s also about $20 cheaper than the Dean banjo case.  It looks great too.\\n\\nOn a side note, a standard acoustic guitar gig bag will also hold the guitar, but the finish on this is so nice, I really wanted to protect it with a hardshell case.\\n\\nUPDATE: After a few weeks of playing this, my finger-picking technique has improved tremendously.  The Backwoods is so resonant and has such a nice projection that even very subtle moves remain audible.  I don\\'t consider myself to be a skilled guitarist, but I sound better than ever when playing this - I liken it to how sub-par singers will sometimes use a lot of reverb on their vocals to cover up imperfections.  I can play softer and with more precision, but still remain audible.  It\\'s been a great guitar to practice with and it\\'s shaken up my sometimes monotonous practice routine.', 'The hybrid guitar-banjo is a controversial beast. To be fair to the rabid defenders of the five-string banjo: if you\\'re looking to play bluegrass, there are definitely techniques and styles that you can\\'t use with a six-string. (It\\'s the absence of that infamous drone string.) That said, if you use it right, this is a wonderful instrument and not just a toy for lazy guitar players.\\n\\nAs for myself, I\\'ve tried to apply some legitimate banjo technique to this guy -- playing it with metal fingerpicks gives it a much brighter sound, and you definitely don\\'t want to strum it like a guitar. Banjos don\\'t have those lowest notes, so keeping to the higher strings makes it sound more like a regular banjo, but honestly you can make some kind of cool sounds with the low strings too. It\\'s worth exploring, even if the lowest strings will betray you as a banjo impostor.\\n\\nAll defenses of the concept aside, this Dean model is everything I hoped it would be. It\\'s lovely to look at, and seems to stay in tune pretty well. It does ship with the bridge detached from the body, so if you aren\\'t handy with instrument repairs (I\\'m not) it might be worthwhile to have a luthier or repairperson set it up for you. With that done, I\\'ve used it for several gigs and I love the sound.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a bluegrass devotee and are passionate about the banjo, there is something to be said for learning the normal one, from scratch. But if you\\'re a rock guitarist/multi-instrumentalist who just wants to try something new, this is a pretty awesome brush to add to your sonic palette.\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'ve recently come up with a modification that brings the \"banjitar\" a little closer to a true banjo playing style. My local music store sells individual loop-end strings, and I was able to have the repair tech switch out the two thickest strings (E and A) for high strings (I used 11 and 16 gauge, same as the high E and the B). It is still tuned like a guitar but now in a sort of re-entrant tuning, which lets me do something resembling Scruggs-style banjo rolls between the high strings on either end. I know a handful of other people online have done this -- just a thought!', 'The fellow who got an obvious returned, abused instrument should have sent it back to whoever sold it to him - it didn\\'t come from China with the screws stripped out etc.  That said, if you don\\'t know how to set up a guitar and/or a banjo, or know someone who does, don\\'t buy this or any banjo or guitar mail-order.  I just got one for an upcoming project. (I play guitar and 5-string banjo but this is for dixieland, and I don\\'t know all the jazz chords on EITHER 5-string or 4-string banjo.)\\n\\nIn \"out of the box\" condition, the instrument was hard to play and sounded like a brick, but it looked like it might have promise and the price was good.  I took off the resonator, loosened the strings, tightened the drum head using a nut driver from my tool kit, retuned the strings, checked the neck adjustment, unscrewed the little triangular cover over the neck adjustment screw, found an allen wrench that fit the neck adjustment screw, loosened the strings again, tightened the screw, retuned the banjo, it still needed more adjustment, loosened the strings, tightened the screw (2 more times), put the cover back over the adjustment screw, took off the strings, oiled the fingerboard, let it soak in for a couple hours, wiped off the excess, put on new strings, tuned the banjo, which takes more tuning than most of my guitars or my 5-string because the bolt neck attachment of ANY banjo is not as solid as a guitar\\'s, and the fat low strings put much more pressure on the neck than banjo strings usually put on a 5-string.  So that part took more time than I expected.  BTW, the strings were D\\'Addario XL Nickel Wound Regular Light Gauge guitar strings # EXL110.  A few people recommended Extra Lights for a plunkier sound, but I don\\'t know what kind of amplification I\\'ll have, so I went for louder tone (and staying in tune longer).\\n\\nBut by the time I was done, I had a good-looking, good-sounding, easy-playing instrument that I\\'m sure my friends will all want to play once I get a case and strap for it and start getting it out of the house.  If you buy this banjo for close to list price in a music store and all of the above work has already been done, you will feel good about your investment.  If you buy this banjo mail-order or from a discount place that doesn\\'t set up their instruments, be prepared to do some work or pay someone to set it up.  That goes for ANY banjo or guitar that costs less than a good used car, however.\\n\\nThe happy ending is that for a good price and a couple hours of work, I now have a musical addition to my musical instrument arsenal that will not only get me through this dixieland project with relative ease, but which will probably find other uses as time goes on. - Paul Race, School of The Rock', 'Clamp works excellently.

It's one of the best you can buy in the price range. I do recommend changing the strings, but I do that with all new basses. Not bashing this one, it's good, but I believe a better choice is the fender affinity jazz bass. It's got a better tone and more tonal options for the money. This basses tone (at least with the Ernie ball strings I have one it now) is a little on the bright sounding side. Nothing wrong with that, but I do like the tonal options for the fender jazz basses. However, the fender jazzes aren't short scale unless you buy a jaguar (which are also pretty good) so yeah. That's my take. Definitely a good bass for the price.

Not like heavy metal pedals which only have tons of gain but don`t sound musical at all.  I must say it`s a breath of fresh air in today`s world where the music is crap now. I find it to be a very versatile pedal as you can play many songs from Chuck Berry`s \"Johnny B.

The problem that they have is that they simply haven\\'t found the right settings on the pedal and the amp, because, after all, the settings on both the amp, and the pedal do make a difference. One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. I have a Digitech Bad Monkey, and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. With this pedal, I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone.', 'Makes angry noise loud.  I love it.  Few options, but the combination of tone/dist and options on the amp work fine.', \"Here's the deal with this pedal. It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. In my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it.\", \"Nice case, comparable in quality to the late 2000's Fender American strat cases..\\n\\nBut everyone already knows that, so will just add that in addition to a Strat and a Tele, this also fits a G&L ASAT (which is longer) and also snugly fits the smaller bodied G&L Fallout\", \"Seems to be a great case.  I love the latches on this thing.  Fits my 2000 Mexican Strat like a glove. It looks like this is going to hold up well for many years, especially since it's going to be just me handling it.  One minor quibble: the metal plate under the handle with the SKB logo was installed a bit crooked and looks kind of cheezy.  Not enough to mar my opinion of this otherwise excellent case.\", \"The classic simplicity of the EB-0 is right up there with the one-pickup Les Paul Jr. in my book.\\n\\nI regularly played a friend's Gibson back in the 70's and always regretted not buying it from him.\\nBut Epiphone has done a great job of reproducing the cosmetic and tonal features I liked.\\n\\nI wanted the short scale and the dot position markers more than I cared about the second pickup on the EB-3. The EQ on my amp gives me all the tonal variation I need and I just think the single pickup looks so much cooler. I was pleasantly surprised at the sheer weight of this thing. I have a Epi SG copy that superficially looks like the same body, but the guitar clearly weighs less than 2/3 if not 1/2 of the bass. Materials and workmanship are excellent for the price (and would still be at double the price).\\n\\nThe three position bridge is a little quirky to adjust until you get the hang of it (the trick is not to let the plate get too far from level while adjusting it, otherwise the screws may jam).\\n\\nThe narrow neck feels great and is truly unique in bass guitars if you've only played Fender-style instruments. The tone from that huge 'bass-bucker' up front is fat and warm - the kind of bass sound that as kids we used to call 'pig bass' - perhaps not as nuanced as a Fender, but the kind of bass sound you could hear blocks away from bands practicing in their garages.\\n\\nMine came with a set of black tapewound strings that I really like - they're not the slick 'wind-less' black Labella's I once used; the windings feel almost like standard flatwounds but the coating is extremely easy on the fingers. I should say I got mine from a third party seller and can't be sure those strings are stock.\\n\\nNot sure what else to say: while Gibson continues to ignore its legacy along with the notion of giving its customers exactly what they want at a reasonable price, the current incarnation of Epiphone seems more than happy to step in and eat Gibson's lunch.\", \"First some background: I've been playing bass for 2 years have used Line 6, Eden, Peavey, Orange, Marshall and Kustom amps and Ibanez, Peavey, JB Player, Fender, Yamaha, and Squire bass'.  This bass was a serious disappointment.  I've got a lot of love for Gibson and (due to $$$) Epiphone.  When I saw the Epiphone EB series in my local guitar shop I fell in love.  How can you not appreciate that SG body, and I've always preferred humbuckers to P or J pickups.  I thought I had found my hearts desire when I picked this up and began to play (classic rock & blues covers for reference) and then my heart broke.  The sound was lousy.  Of course I tried a different EB bass and different amps but the situation never improved.  Despite my sincerest wishes I can't recommend this excellent looking bass to anyone (unless they're looking for wall art or are willing to switch out the pickups).  You can pay the same price and get much better tone (I would recommend a Squire Jaguar if you really want a humbucker or if you want more tone versatility a Yamaha RBX 170).\", \"One of my girlfriend's cousins and I purchased this bass for my girlfriend who wants to start learning how to play. She's a huge music fan, her favorite guitar style is the SG shape, and her favorite colors are black and red, so she broke down crying out of joy for a good 10 minutes when we gave it to her on Christmas morning. One of her other cousins plays both bass and regular guitar, and both him and his guitar teacher tried out the bass and said it feels and sounds extremely good, especially given the price. During the relatively short time I've spent with it I would have to agree, and there have been absolutely zero problems with it since we received it.\\n\\nOne additional thing worth noting about this bass is that it looks way better in person compared to the pictures on Amazon. The wood grain shows through the red finish when you look at it up close or from a short distance which gives it a really nice, classy appearance that doesn't come across in the relatively low-res on the product page.\", 'I\\'ve played bass and guitar for over 30 years now. I\\'ve owned some excellent instruments along the way. Recently, for the first time, I decided I wanted to get something along the lines of the short-scale Gibson basses used by \\'60s British musicians such as Jack Bruce of Cream and Glenn Cornick of Jethro Tull. Real vintage \\'60s Gibsons are rather thin on the ground and quite expensive when still in good working condition, so a modern reissue was clearly the way to go. A bit of research suggested that the best candidate would be the Epiphone Elite EB-3 produced in the early 2000s, but those are no longer being made and I wasn\\'t able to find one.\\n\\nThis left me with two main choices: the Epiphone EB-0 or the Gibson SG Standard Bass. (Epiphone also makes an EB-3, but only in long scale.) I found both of these in a local music store and was able to try them out side by side. Given the huge price difference (you can buy five Epiphones for the price of one Gibson) and the fact that the Epiphone lacks a bridge pickup, I expected the choice to be obvious and immediate in the Gibson\\'s favor. I was mightily surprised, however, at how well the inexpensive Epiphone held its own against the higher-end instrument. While the SG Standard Bass certainly can produce a brighter and more diverse range of tones due to its dual-pickup design, the Epiphone\\'s tone is quite pleasant and a pretty good approximation of the heavy, warm roar characteristic of the classic \\'60s short-scale Gibson basses. (Listen to Jethro Tull\\'s song \"Nothing Is Easy\" for the sound of a vintage Gibson EB-0, or Cream\\'s \"White Room\" for the EB-3.) The feel and playability of both instruments are excellent; the differences are not all that significant, though some may prefer one or the other. The Gibson\\'s fretboard is slightly wider, but I preferred the narrower Epiphone.\\n\\nIn the end, I could not consider the five times greater price of the Gibson to be a worthwhile investment, so I bought the Epiphone and have found it to be an excellent instrument. Its range of tones is narrow; if the classic \\'60s Gibson sound is what you\\'re looking for, look no further, but otherwise you should look elsewhere.', \"This is an excellent low-cost bass. It's not an SG, but it's perfectly playable. The strings were set far too low when it arrived, and everything buzzed. After a little setup work, it played fine, and intonation was remarkably good for an inexpensive instrument. I bought some Fender short scale strings, which had a brighter sound than the strings that came on the bass. It doesn't have a wide range of tones, but you can use downstream modelers to get any sound that you want. It puts out a strong, clean signal, and the short scale is good for us guitar players who play bass only occasionally and find a full scale bass awkward. I plugged it directly into my Focusrite audio interface--worked perfectly.\", 'LOVE THIS! :D', 'SO DA OBSOME! LOVING THE COLOR! :D :D :D', 'I LOVE THIS COLOR! AHHHHHH :D :D :D', 'Looks great and does the job!', \"Growing up my friend had one of these and I almost instantly fell in love. It's really easy to use and the sound is great! If you're looking for an overdrive this may not be the best pedal but for good old distortion look no further! the metal construction is solid and I never really worry about it.\", \"I find that if I play this pedal along with my Boss Super Chorus pedal, my guitar with Tex-Mex pickups captures a lot Gilmour's sound tonality.\", 'Excellent case for the money!! Well worth it. Slim, sleak, and sturdy. Really like the stackable feature also. I will definitely be getting more of these cases.', 'I bought this case to house my Strat. It fits like a glove, and is a solid, beautiful case.

I believe that Boss can correct the poor design creating the unbearable hiss.', \"Think of this as an artist's tool.  And for every job there is the 'right' tool.  Is this the best distortion pedal?  That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it.  If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles.  It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s.  But arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise.  This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. It it doesn't make sense, there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger.  It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Kurt Cobain. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians.  It's built like a brick and durable as all get-out.  I found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair. I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly I don't detect any tonesuck with it.  I've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking.  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads.  With the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like Tech 21, I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp.  So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG, the problem is in your amp.\", 'You won\\'t \"shut the front door\"...you\\'ll blow it off the house...pure, gradual ,and natural ,distortion sounds..you set the parameters. you set the boost, the tone, and the drive...it\\'s simple, it\\'s basic....good to have in your effects arsenal....tip: put a compressor in front of this and you\\'ll go into orbit...sustain forever..for those long dramatic notes..highly recommend !!!', \"... it's a very generic-sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp.  The same is true of many of the pedals from this era, including the (gasp!) Tube Screamer.  The Tube Screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp, but not too many people will tell you that it's a great stand-alone distortion because it's not.  Same goes for the Boss DS-1.  Now, here's where things get interesting:  There are PLENTY of modifications that can be done to this pedal by Keely, Monte Allums, and others, that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast, dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks.  For the cost of this pedal, and the $30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod, are well worth it.  Mine is modified with the Monte Allums Tri-Gain Rectifier modification and it's absolutely killer.  I use it as a lead boost, but by itself it's a nice overdriven tone that you'll find plenty of use for.  If you want a basic, solid, well-built distortion pedal, this is it - but by itself the Boss DS-1 is really nothing special.  But as a platform for great-sounding mods, you can't go wrong.\", \"For your convenience, and so you can get a perspective what this pedal is all about, I will break up my review into several parts: (1) functionality (weighted value: 40%), (2) quality and built (weighted value: 30%, (3) value (weighted value: 25%), and (4) appearance (weighted value: 5%).\\n\\n(1) Functionality: this is going to be hit the hardest. I'd give it 2/5 stars. Why? There's nothing unique nor special about the distortion on this pedal. To be honest, I don't even find it to be much better than my amplifier's distortion, and my amp's nothing too special either- it's a Marshall solid state half stack. (I mean, it's a good amp, but not like those nice tube amps). I think the Boss Overdrive pedals are cooler, or even the Ibanez Tubescreamers. This pedal simply provides some volume kick with fuzz. Maybe that's what you like, of course- if that's the case, then go right ahead and buy this pedal. However, if you're looking for something more, especially a tone with a gain boost, look elsewhere.. this is only useful if you want a convenient fuzz at your feet.\\n\\n(2) Quality: 5/5. Boss's reputation for quality isn't a fluke; this pedal's built like a tank. As long as you don't remove the knobs and purposely break them, and as long as you don't drop the pedal from the top of a sky scraper, the unit will last for a very, very long time.\\n\\n(3) Value: 4/5. For $40, I'd say this is a fairly priced pedal. It provides your fuzz/volume needs quite well, and though I don't believe the pedal's sounds are too unique, the price is modest enough that it's a good deal.\\n\\n(4) Appearance: 5/5. This might be the most subjective part of my review, but in my opinion (and I'm not alone in typing this), the Boss products tend to look really professional, and their simple design makes them stand out. I can't think of any improvement on Boss's part to make the appearance look good. Again, looks don't really matter, so I'm only giving this portion of the assessment 5%.\\n\\nFinal score: 2*(0.4)+5*(0.3)+4*(0.25)+5*(0.05)=3.55. I'll round this down to 3 stars, as its sounds and tone simply don't produce a 4-star quality effect.\\n\\nWould I buy the pedal again? Sure, if I didn't have a volume or fuzz boost already. I would buy this pedal in a heartbeat, especially at $40.\\n\\nI hope this helps; please do not hesitate to comment or ask questions.\", 'There\\'s some element of nostalgia with the DS-1 that I\\'ve just never understood.  I know they\\'re cheap.  I know they\\'re incredibly durable (as are all BOSS pedals).  I know everybody had one or tried one at some point, and Kurt Cobain (apparently) used them with his Fenders.\\n\\nBut I also know that I\\'ve almost never been happy with the tone I get when I step on the pedal.  It\\'s incredibly thin and harsh, and lacks proper sustain, even cranked all the way.  I\\'ve used it on Marshall solid state amps and Vox tube amps.  Fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers.  You can mess with the TONE and DIST dials all you want, but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals, and even on-amp distortion, with a richer, deeper tone.\\n\\nCoincidentally, I also used the BOSS OS2 Overdrive/Distortion for many years, which is supposedly merges/blends a DS-1 with an OD-1.  That pedal isn\\'t ideal either, but if I turn the knob all the way to \"distortion\", it\\'s a much better tone than I ever got out of a DS-1.\\n\\nThen again, it is very dependable and usually only $40 (or less), so I can\\'t really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone\\'s collection.  That just doesn\\'t mean you\\'ll want to use it all the time.', \"This capo is as good as I've ever used and its in pink which perfectly matchs my shell pink strat. Great deal.\", \"I've always used kyser capos and they're great!  Not much to say but if you need a good capo this is the choice to make, I like the design and ergonomics of this capo a lot.\", 'This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40.

It\\'s met those needs and exceeded my expectations in several more areas.\\n\\nThe amp simulations the Micro Cube provides are, well let\\'s just say they\\'re vaguely reminiscent of the amps they are trying to emulate.  The sounds still differ from one another enough to be useful, though, and this little box can pump out some serious (digital) distortion.  It\\'s also fairly loud.  Like the Pignose and other small amps, you can also mic this amp and get some really suprising results.  Using the headphone jack as a line out will obviously yield pretty much the same result you\\'re hearing through the speaker, as the sound is entirely digital.\\n\\nEffects aren\\'t too bad.  Trem is pretty good, reverb a notch behind, and I\\'d stay light on the Cube\\'s flanger and chorus.  Forget the \"digital tuning fork\" - it\\'s just a button that generates a tone to tune to.  Any kind of separate tuner is far more useful.\\n\\nBatteries seem to last forever with this thing.

I have a Fender wannabe guitar, and a Fender Sidekick 10 which means my gear isn't the best but the pedal produces a wide variety of distortion and tone changes which keeps me interested.  I am having so much fun that I don't even notice my fingers hurt anymore.  Honestly, this is an essential buy when starting out along with headphones and a cord extension so the police don't come a knockin.\\n\\n(update Sept 2012)\\nIt is a year later and I have a much better guitar and amp and a lot more knowledge.  I am glad I got the DS-1 but for other reasons.  Sure it made me enjoy playing and practicing a lot more but I soon found the sound was off considering I like more blue and classic rock.  Again for the money I don't think you can beat it but more importantly when you have a few buck you can send it out for modification from Keeley.  Initially I had wished I went with and overdrive (OCD or Boss OD-3) but with the mod done by Keeley I have a super flexible pedal that cover just about all the sounds I need.  In closing, spend the $40 buck and get this....and then when you start wishing it could do more send it off to be modified and you will thank yourself later.\", \"I am laughing to myself reading some of these reviews - I have been playing for 47 years and survived the Arbiter Fuzz Face, (yes, I had one) which to me sounded a lot like an amp with a blown speaker. Anything the industry has come out with since then has been an improvement.\\n\\nAs a general rule, I don't really use sound effects these days (mostly because I like the sound of my amp - crazy, huh?) but every now and then I like a little reverb and when practicing it's nice to have some distortion to get a little more sustain at lower volumes. I wasn't expecting much for the price but in this particular case I thought the pedal went very well with the rig I plugged it into (in this case, a Fender Champ 600 and a Squire Jazzmaster).\\n\\nTo me, Fender style guitars and pickups have a tendency to sound a bit thin played through distortion pedals and solid state amps. Pickups like P-90's are a bit better for this, but for the best sound, a hum canceling pickup like the Gibson PAF (insert your own favorite here) works best when playing with distortion, so in my opinion, if you have a solid state amp you will want to put some thought into what guitar and pedal you want to use with it (assuming you have a selection of them, like I do), or, to put it another way, if you only have one guitar (and know how to use it!) you may want to put a little more thought into your amp when pairing it with your guitar of choice. I say this because I have seen a lot of young players who buy gear based more on their budget than with an eye to getting the sound they want.\\n\\nThat said, depending on what you ended up with, this pedal may not work for you. On the other hand, as someone noted, if you have a tube amp, or, as I said above, a Gibson or Epiphone style guitar you might like the sound of this one.\\n\\nI thought the pedal was a fair approximation of an overdriven tube sound (again, when used with a tube amp!) but keep in mind that comparisons like this never survive side by side comparisons (I mean, really, combo modeling amps don't REALLY sound like a Marshall stack when played next to a Marshall stack) so when I say it approximates an overdriven tube sound, that's as accurate as I can be about it - it sounds enough like an overdriven tube amp to my ear that I am happy with it. Your results may vary. One thing for sure is that the price is hard to beat, and as others have noted, Boss sound effects pedals will last long after you have gotten tired of them and sold them at the garage sale.\\n\\nComparisons with other pedals, whether more or less expensive, are really of no value, this is going to be YOUR pedal, and it's what you think that matters. If possible, try a friend's, or go to a music store and try it first, although if it was me I would just buy the pedal there after having tried it.\\n\\nThat said, if you have a tube amp or play guitars with humbucking style pickups through decent solid state amps, you may like it. If anybody says anything, just tell them an old fart on the internet who has played through just about everything said so. And remember: 90% of happiness in life is the ability to manage your expectations.\", \"Basic distortion / nothing fantastic. Range is limited . Its a good pedal for someone just starting out.

It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl. It's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion. The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp. You can dial the tone in, but it's a pretty harsh sounding.\\n\\nThat said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to. My amp gives me a nice warm crunch, classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound I wanted, and it does so flawlessly.\\n\\nIt took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1. It's BOSS, so it will last forever.\\n\\nTh only drawback is that it's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere. Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing, but word to the wise, don't pay more than $40 new for this thing.\", 'From Greg Abrams review, entitled \"For all but the tone snobs,\" a review further down on this product\\'s page:\\n\\n\"Alright, so you want to get a good (if somewhat \"basic\") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal.\"\\n\\nI strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.\\n\\nI\\'ve played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they\\'re available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn\\'t always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).\\n\\nSo I plugged it in and didn\\'t really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I\\'ve read the Japanese made DS-1\\'s are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.\\n\\nBut, like many newer players, I didn\\'t know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I\\'ve bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.\\n\\nSo here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol\\' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Boss-DS-2-Turbo-Distortion/dp/B0002CZV8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion</a>:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I\\'m a Boss hater (I\\'m certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I\\'ll start with the DS-1\\'s big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2\\'s all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pro-Co-RAT2/dp/B0002MSQVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pro Co RAT2</a>:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You\\'ve heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I\\'ve never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a \"big amp\" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/EHX-Little-Big-Muff/dp/B000T517Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">EHX Little Big Muff</a>:  The Big Muff is another pedal you\\'ve heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70\\'s for classic rock tones, also in the 90\\'s and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MXR-Distortion/dp/B0002E520C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MXR Distortion +</a>:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn\\'t cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy\\'s famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Danelectro-CM-1-Cool-Cat-Metal/dp/B000A40NAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal</a>:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That\\'s a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I\\'ve tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that\\'s actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Joyo-JF-03-Crunch-Distortion/dp/B005LYIW3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion</a>:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin\\' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!\\n\\nSpeaking of Joyo, I\\'ve had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I\\'m honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MOEN-MO-FM-Fuzz-Moo/dp/B007L5PVI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moo</a>&nbsp;which honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I\\'ve ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).\\n\\nHopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can\\'t actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.\\n\\nI should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that\\'s okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that\\'s affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I\\'ve mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.', 'Guitarists have become a bunch of cork-sniffers. There are so many players more concerned with the name on the headstock of their guitar and their amp and the endless \"boutique\" pedals in their collections that many seem unable or unwilling to give a listen to \"stock\" gear, or anything that doesn\\'t cost an arm and a leg.\\n\\nThe fact is that if you\\'re a gigging musician, and I am, you come to realize that all those subtle, detailed nuances of tone that so many want to obsess over get lost in the band mix, and in the poor acoustics of wherever you\\'re playing.  Yes, we want to sound good to ourselves because that\\'s inspiring, but frankly, I don\\'t need $200+ dollar distortion/OD pedals to be inspired.\\n\\nI haven\\'t owned a DS-1 in a long time, but recently got one because I was looking for a distortion pedal on a budget.  Frankly, I\\'d forgotten how musical this pedal is.  With the distortion set to minimum (it never gets clean) it\\'s a good, moderate-gain overdrive that still lets your guitar\\'s basic tone get through.  I play a strat & and jazzmaster - those guitars still sound like themselves with this thing.  With the gain at halfway you get great AD/DC crunch.  And even with the gain maxed out you still get excellent note definition on chords.  What more could you want?  Sure, it\\'s \"old school\" rock distortion. The usual \"may not appeal to metalheads\" caveat applies, maybe. Combine this with an eq and you could scoop the mids as much as you want.\\n\\nI also have a Barber LTD (great, relatively cheap \"boutique\" moderate gain OD that doesn\\'t break the bank) and a Visual Sound Route 66, which is a tubescreamer clone (with much more gain) and a compressor in one pedal.  Both the LTD & Rt 66 have the usual TS9 midrange hump, though much less pronounced on the LTD.  What\\'s refreshing about the DS-1 is that the strong mids are there, but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer, so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party.  The tone on the DS-1 can get very bright, but as I indicated I play with single coils, and I have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob - I generally run it around 9-10:00.\\n\\nOverall this pedal is a steal - look around and find a used one for a good price. I\\'d considered a modtone Speedbox, but decided to go with the generally bulletproof Boss instead, for basically the same price.  I couldn\\'t be happier.', \"This unit is a servicable tuner, and metronome, but you can do better in both departments for sure.\\n\\nI find it useless for acoustic guitars if there is any background noise.  Even just a TV on with normal volume nearby seems to prevent it from getting a clean read.\\n\\nThe metronome is annoying because of the lack of volume, and the fact that it's plays an electronic tone instead of clicks.  Not a good idea.\\n\\nMetronomes should click..\\n\\nclick click click click....\", 'This pedal has been around for a long time, and though the overall quality has declined as Boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals, the boss ds-1 remains the staple image of distortion stompbox\\'s. The ds-1 is a no-frills tank of a pedal; it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as Michael Moore stepping on it, so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it.\\n  This pedal doesn\\'t replicate any type of amplifier-it\\'s not a \"Marshall-in-a-box, or a mesa boogie, or a vox, or a Fender; from a tonal aspect it isn\\'t complex or dynamic. It will add plenty of grind to your tone, and plenty of hum to go with it. If you\\'re looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15-watt practice amp, look no further. If you have a decent tube amp, look elsewhere, because with this pedal, you get what you pay for, and it simply will not do a quality amp justice.\\n  Pros: Inexpensive, good build quality, distorts your signal.\\nCons: Lots of hum, the tone control gets really shrill really fast.\\n  Without the excessive hum and almost-unusable tone control, this would get 4 stars.', 'cool pedal, good distortions. Comes with a manual to show you a bunch of combinations.\\n\\nGood quality, wouls recommend to a friend', \"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal, you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount, if necessary) and more tone control, but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range.\", \"I must have bought my DS-1 twenty years ago, and it was long neglected, but when comparing all my pedals I decided this was the only one that let my playing subtleties show through. Many pedals today are obsessed with ultra high gain, which makes you sound anonymous. Here, you get distortion that begins with a mild crunch near to your clean signal, and moves to a searing sound. The tone knob goes from a dark thick sound to a bright, thinner and progressively less bassy one. I am slightly amazed at how many good combinations I can get by adjusting these two knobs, and moving from the neck pickup to the bridge on a Strat. Try Tone = 11 O' clock with Gain all the way down, or Tone all the way down with Gain = 1 O' clock; two very different and useable sounds. Sometimes I wish the pedal had a little more bass response to it, and you can forget rich tube-y harmonics, but then the idea is to get a brighter, more cutting sound, so I can't really complain. I play rockabilly, '50s style rock 'n roll and Hendrix/Trower type stuff, so this suits me just fine. (And it's a standard platform for modification if you want to experiment). Recommended.\", 'I bought this pedal for use in my project studio.  I wanted some creamy overdrive and increased sustain for my Strat.  It\\'s a good pedal, but it does require a little finesse.  If you turn everything up to \"11,\" it sounds pretty bad--harsh and abrasive.  By backing off the output (\"volume\" knob) from the guitar, you can get some good rock tones, at a variety of distortion levels.  Want it a little grungier?  Turn up the distortion.  A little edgier?  Turn up the tone control, to increase the treble.  Use the volume knob to control your levels into your amp or mixer.  Simple.  Just don\\'t max out the guitar output going into the unit, and you\\'ll have tons of tonal colors to play with.  I\\'m running the pedal as a DI box, straight into the mixer, with some outboard compression from a rack mounted unit.  Makes some very sweet sounds.  Very easy for recording.  But one caveat: This is pretty much for lead guitar, only.  It\\'s too grungy for chord work.', 'Excellent product and service!!!', \"I've had this nice little practice amp for quite some time. I've also got the big brother Cube 80XL and the almost twin Bass Micro Cube. I live in an apartment and like to practice - without headphones *and* staying friendly with my neighbors. At those kind of low volumes a large amp sounds very flat. This micro cube sounds *wonderful* in a smaller setting. I've also had/tried a Peavy nanovyper, older Marshall and Ibanez mini amps (think both were 15 amp models). The Peavy does have more effects, and the other two much more limited. In all cases - the Roland amp simply has a superior speaker system and base clarity. This seems to be a characteristic of all the Roland amps I've tried - superior clean sound and more conservative effects. The effects tend to be not as extravagant or adjustable as some others perhaps, but they are very solid and tasteful. Preferable to how I gear up - I have pedals do most of the work and want a very nice output. Getting back to those effects - they always work very well on top of what ever input via a bunch of pedals arrives at the amp - quality there. I can't speak for the battery operation - mine is always plugged in. Once you go past a typical house room size - you will run out of enough speaker ooomph. Beyond what this amp was designed for. Again - it sounds wonderful at small room volumes - easy straight forward to use 3 band EQ and amp settings - very solid, standard effects.

Don\\'t get me wrong, I have some nice boutique pedals and mods (like the Cusack Screamer and the Keeley MT-2) that I would never part with. But here\\'s the thing...the stock DS-1 stands proud even in such company. Why? A few simple observations:\\n\\n1) Boss has been selling this pedal with great success since 1978, regardless of the fact that...\\n\\n2) Due to the toughness, you\\'ll likely never need to replace one of these tanks.\\n  2a) There is a profusion of overdrive and distortion pedals on the market, both corporate and boutique varieties.\\n\\n3) Many outstanding guitar players have used this pedal in the studio and on the road, including Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, John Petrucci, etc... Sure, some are using \"modified\" versions now, like Vai\\'s Keeley edition. But you don\\'t tamper with what you don\\'t like. If the foundation isn\\'t solid, you replace it. I also own the Ibanez Vai Jemini pedal and what they basically did (in my opinion) was take his tube screamer and DS-1 pedals and put them into one box for convenience. Same thing with Satriani\\'s Vox Satchurator pedal. You know someone really loves a pedal when they use it as a template in designing their own signature line. I don\\'t have any proof that they did this, but it does sound like it in a side-by-side comparison.\\n\\n4) Now consider that the Jemini and Satchurator are $199 and $129, respectively. Nice pedals? Yes. Worth up to four times the DS-1? After using both for a few months, I\\'m not entirely convinced of that. Since I\\'m a pedal collector, they\\'re staying put in my house. But I don\\'t see a whole lot in them that really blows away the core DS-1 sound.\\n\\nSeriously, if you\\'re looking for a simple, set and forget distortion that has a good basic tone for rock and metal, the Boss DS-1 is a great value.

The microcube already has plenty of good reviews, but I\\'d like to point out something that may not be so obvious (it wasn\\'t to me); it makes a good preamp for an existing effects-challenged large amplifier. In my case this was a really old \"Kent\" with the electronics ripped-out sometime in the Carter administration/replaced 12\" speakers + a 20-watt (so they say) \"Lepai\" stereo amp + the wondrous microcube, with the Lepai plugged into the cube\\'s \"record out/phones\" jack (through a hacked-up cable) -- when something\\'s plugged in there, the microcube\\'s speaker is silent. The result gives me my ridiculous Kent miraculously resurrected with all the microcube effects/amp sims! The microcube\\'s portable-enough so you could actually use something like that to play somewhere, if you had some beloved old wreck you wanted to upgrade with reverb etc....', 'It is a fun little practice amp, and I agree with the praise it gets. The positives have been covered so I\\'ll point out a few (minor) things I don\\'t like.\\n\\nFirst of all the power button is on the back, which is annoying. The rest of the controls are on top, why do I have to grope around the back to find the most important button. Plus I keep it in a cabinet so I have to pull it out to turn it on yand off.\\n\\nNext! I wish they\\'d just name the settings \"clean\", \"overdrive\", \"distortion\", and so on. JC Clean, Black Panel, Brit combo and R-Fier mean nothing to me.\\n\\nThen there\\'s another minor annoyance that the input is recessed. A 90 degree angle plug won\\'t fit unless you run it around the back.\\n\\nLastly, the amp is solid and rugged but that means it\\'s heavy. Not heavy like I can\\'t pick it up, just heavy for something called a micro amp.\\n\\nNone of these are deal breakers, just things I find annoying. Overall I have to say I prefer my VOX mini 3.\\n\\nUpdate: Roland basically fixed my important concerns with the new version of the Micro Cube, the GX. it\\'s over a pound lighter, the power switch is on top where it belongs, plus it\\'s got more features like the Cube Jam software ( which I don\\'t really use but it looks cool). I\\'m not thrilled with the built in effects but they\\'re still fun to mess with and you can always use pedals instead.\\n\\nSo basically, the Micro Cube GX is a strong buy, the older version you\\'ll want to avoid (my opinion).\\n\\nBuy the one that says \"CUBE\" across the grill and you\\'ll have a great little practice amp..', 'My son was just learning to play guitar so this was a great part of a gift for his birthday.', \"This is maybe the third or fourth capo I've tried and it is the best so far.

Plenty loud for my needs too.  It won\\'t work well for jamming with a full band, but that\\'s not what it was designed for.', \"I bought this amp to replace a Squier SP-10 that came with my guitar.  The Squier had no effects, just a clean channel and an overdrive button.  I couldn't afford a bunch of pedals, but I wanted some effects so I could get cool sounds from my electric guitar.  I saw the reviews for this little amp on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It is Awesome!  For such a small amp, the output is plenty loud for practicing at home, and it runs on batteries, too, so I can take it anywhere.  The effects are better than I'd hoped for.  This is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer, but for an intermediate level guitarist (like me) who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family, this is the amp to get.  It has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus, flanger, phaser, or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay.

This tuner is no different.  Extremely accurate and versatile as both a tuner and metronome.  Works for bass & guitar whether plugged in or not (most accurate with the cable run).  Purchased it for my son to use with his bass and he loves it.  It has both a visual signal and/or audible chirp when your instrument is in tune which is really nice.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the battery compartment cover has a tendency to fall off with even nominal impact.  This is easily countered by taping the cover on at each battery change, but I think that looks cheap and a functioning battery cover is essential to the fit and finish of a quality product from a company such as boss and should be a given.

Now I regret it. Sometimes I have to pluck the strings especially the high e several times to get it to register. I was confused with how to use the metronome. It had things like 0/4 1/4 etc. I didn't get that. The metronome was strange because it did not display time signatures . Also the beep sound was unusual for a metronome.\", \"For the price I've seen better...it really isn't all it's cracked up to be and the construction of it is just wrong...plastic? Really?  I took it back and got something better.\", \"Reading through the reviews for the TU-80, it seems theres a lot of grumbling that misses the point of what a tuner should do. Above all, it should be accurate and clear in the readings it gives. Too often tuners fail to do this. The reading wanders back and forth, never quite settling on whether the note is flat, sharp, or dead on. For a tuner, this is entirely unacceptable. A tuners job is to tell us whether or not the note is in tune. If the tuner cant make up its mind, then whats the point of having it?\\n\\nWhile I cant say Ive tried every tuner on the market, Ive tried many. Most recently I auditioned the Guitar Research JC 200, Sabine MT 9000, Korg TM-40, Fishman FT-1, Korg MA-30, and the Korg GT-3. With the exception of the Sabine, all of them more or less display the problem I described above. (The Sabine MT 9000 has a different problem: it takes too long to give a reading after you play a string.) For my taste, the Boss TU-80 was superior to all the tuners listed here. It was quick to give a reading, and the reading didn't waver about.\\n\\nCurrently, these are my standard tuner recommendations to my guitar students:\\n\\n For a cheap tuner, the Korg GA-1.\\n For a mid-priced tuner, the Boss TU-80.\\n For a higher priced tuner, the Boss TU-12.\\n For gigging players, the Intellitouch PT30 or the SpeedPro Chromatic Guitar Tuner\\n\\nRegarding the complaints that the TU-80 has trouble hearing a note: Most tuners have this problem to some degree, depending on the player, the instrument, and how far away the tuner is placed from the instrument. For acoustic guitarists, I suggest laying the guitar on your lap (soundboard side up) and setting the tuner directly on the soundboard. You neednt bang out the note, as doing this on the bass strings will cause the tuner to rattle against the soundboard. Just pluck the string at a medium volume, and the tuner usually will have no trouble sensing the vibration of the soundboard. Bear in mind also that some tuners have trouble hearing the bass strings. (The original Intellitouch tuner was notorious for this.) If your tuner doesnt hear the bass strings well, play the string at the 12th fret harmonic.\", 'This Capo looks great and does the job.

I am constantly losing picks, which is my fault, not Dunlop's.  It just made sense to buy the 72 pack to save some $ on the cost per pick.  I keep a handful in each of my guitar cases and a few in my wallet.  My advice is to try out as many different picks as you possibly can, until you find the one (or few) that best fit your needs.

I like how these feel when they work, and they do when new, but when they fail it can get ugly.\\nIn my band I have to play acoustic guitar to compete in volume with banjo (which I cannot but I try anyway), so I tend to play hard. I typically use medium gauge strings.\\nThe problem is that sometimes they chip when strummed hard, and the edge becomes jagged. I'm not talking about normal wear, i.e. strings abrading/scraping pick materials away slowly and gradualy. In the case of ultex, even though the normal wear is much slower than delrin and celluloid, suddenly some tiny chunk of material flies away and that's it. Once this happens the edge catches the strings and I cannot play solo any more, so I need to swap the pick in the next song to continue playing. I keep the pick anyway and sand the jagged edge later.\\nTo give this thing some credit, I've never had a chipping problem when I play electrics with 10-42 set.

I like the feel of the those picks, my only complaint really is that I'm pretty hard on a pick (mostly from practicing scales); I tend to wear the edges and tip down pretty fast, but I can never bring myself to just throw them out. I always seem to have piles of useless picks!\\n\\nI tried the 1.00 and 1.14 mm ULTEX picks for the first time maybe two years ago, and I have to admit, I think these are my new favorites. They have a nice feel, sort of that same almost organic feel of a regular Tortex. They're also very stiff, and because of that I'm generally using a thinner pick now. The best part is that it takes me quite a bit longer to wear them down, although it does still happen eventually.\\n\\nI think they are also kind of cool looking, sort of a gel thing going on... my only complaint though is that if you put or drop them on the wrong sort of surface they are like *gone*, completely invisible. It's really weird because the color of the pick is often completely different, lol there's some strange voodoo going on here. I guess I wish they were made in different colors so they were easy to find (who knows, maybe they are?).\\n\\nI also tend to use classic medium celluloid picks when I'm playing my acoustic, but for my electrics I love these thing!\", \"I thought these picks would be better than Dunlop's Tortex picks but they seem to be more frail.

I sold off my rat and tried out a number of other distortion boxes at a local shop and settled on the Big Muff Pi. This thing is rich. The complexity of the distortion is incredible compared to what you get with most other pedals--must be the brilliant Russian engineering behind it. It has three knobs: Volume, Sustain, and Tone. The Volume is obvious, the sustain is really the distortion level. For the Bass, I run the sustain very low, and the volume higher and get a great mix of clean and distorted tone. Sometimes I run the sustain knob turned all the way off and this thing still drives the sound nicely. Too much distortion on the bass and you loose your ability to cut through the rest of the band in my opinion. The Tone knob adjusts the center frequency of the distortion. I run mine way over to the left and distort the low end around 200-400 kHz. You can crank it around and get anything from a low grumbly distortion tall the way to a really tinny irritating heavy metal sound. This thing is versatile, and no matter how you like your settings, the distortion it produces is rich in harmonic overtones, multi-dimensional, and unlike any other boxes I've tried. Highly recommended.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that this box is designed to work only on battery power--no AC adapter at all.

I have now read similar complaints form other posters (which I should have read before -- I think all the glowing reports are either from shills or total beginner recorder players who mistake the fine finish for fine musical craftsmanship). What didn't this company turn out a precision instrument to begin with? And is it made in China or Germany -- it sure plays like it was made in China.

At the time of this review this product page contains various sizes that you select and purchase. Although all of the cymbals on this page are A Custom crashes in various sizes the diameter is not the only difference.\\n\\nBoth of the cymbals I own are significantly different. The 16\" has a higher pitch, opens rapidly on attack and has rapid decay. It\\'s perfect for accent-type crashes or marking the one (or four depending on the style of music you play) coming out of a fill.  The bell is fairly small and the cymbal itself is not nearly as versatile as its 18\" sibling.\\n\\nThe 18\" crash offered from this page has a much lower pitch, and does not open as quickly or fully in attack. It also has a longer decay time. In fact the attack takes a few milliseconds to transition to the sustain, and die to the longer decay rate it seems to go on forever unless you choke it with your fingers. It also has a substantial bell that can be used for cutting accents or ride patterns, and the cymbal itself can function as a crash/ride. As you play closer to the edge the pitch will become slightly lower than its basic fundamental.\\n\\nAs you can see, not every crash on this page is the same. In fact, the two I just described are practically polar opposites in every way from physical configuration to sonic characteristics. In case you are wondering I own both of these because they came bundled with a promotional box set. Combined they greatly expand your sound palette; however, if you are searching for individual crashes do choose carefully because there is more to these than mere size.', 'Probably the best kapo out on the market.

It is a great improvement, and the pickup really shines when used when the amp has some crunch on it.  The pickup is pretty high-output compared to everything else on my other guitars, so it's a bit difficult to rein in the sound and clean it up, but, as I said, it does crunch/gainy tones very well, and it's very reasonably-priced.  The only reason why this pickup doesn't get 5 stars from me is simply because there are better pickups on the market--much pricier pickups, to be fair (Lundgren, BKP, etc), but I'd have to reserve a 5-star rating for them.\", \"I did some research before buying 2 new humbuckers for my Ibanez S470 and came to the conclusion that the dynamic duo of Seymour Duncan's SH-2 and SH-4 were for me. I found the 2 sold together as a combo pack for a great deal at $110, when otherwise they're $70-$75 each. So I was happy I got what I wanted for much less than I was prepared to pay but enough about that.\\n\\nI gathered from the Seymour Duncan website that these 2 pickups are his favorite combination as they allow for the widest range and diversity for sound and playing style. The site also lets you see which famous musicians are using their pickups as well and it turned out that most of the rockers and metalheads listed had these 2 in their arsenal. That helped since I play mostly hard rock and metal.\\n\\nAfter I spent some time with the SH-2 on clean, I switched on the SH-4 and went all out with the distortion on my Boss Metal Zone pedal. The first thought I had was that this sounded like high definition distortion. The sound just popped out as clear, detailed and dynamic. Power chords sound that much more powerful. Chunky and fat. Tone and sustain are increased for single notes. Bends squeal and hang on forever. I also experimented with some classic rock and blues sounds and they sounded much improved as well. The SH-4 LOVES distortion as it seems to grab every little sound and is eager to go as fast or hard as you want to. It also gives a unique custom sound which is what I've been looking for.\\n\\nI'm glad I did my research and chose the SH-4. It wants to rock and is very versitle. It'll take everything you can throw at it and come back for more. It'll satisfy many players of many styles, from light to hard and heavy, the SH-4 doesn't disappoint.

Options may include smashing the foam down in that section, OR carefully cutting the lining, pulling it back, carving away enough of the foam to allow the pre-amp controls to slide in cleanly.\\n\\nOverall, this is a nice case, and at the $115 price point, cheaper than the SKB.\\n\\nI have an ABT60E, and I ended up buying a Roadrunner Jumbo Case from Guitar center, for $105 + tax.

Your best bet when you get the thing is to peel that tape off and replace it with a strip of electrician's tape.  At least you get a little padding from the rubber.

I found a way around the all issues so there you have it. Just buy a new one.\", \"At age 59 I decided to try guitar synthesizer world with very limited knowledge. I bought GR-33 Roland. I was in love with the unit use Gk-2a. I turned 60 Time became an issue .sold GR-33 bought almost $500 more GR-55. within one month realized what a disappointment. It was too many sound in each group you had to constantly edit . Sold half price only 4 month old just the unit, buyer was a bass player who told me people don't need your pickup GK-3. I guess what they use is Gk-3B for bass. Buyer got a good deal because I by mistake send my Roland cable . but he told me to try GR-20 . He was right easy really no need for manuals. I used a goodin guitar. I mostly play nylon string. It is well built but input jack 13 pins was acting. BE Aware If you have goodin brand new buy an extra unit circuit board with both 13 pin and 1/4 jack because if your 13 pin acts all Godin reps only want to sell guitars not repair or parts. The local  guitar repair shop decline to install a new 13 pin input jack and told me godin them self can't fix it .So far I tried to give some of my experiences to those that are new to this . I install around 12 of these type Pick ups, the last one was an Axon 101 pick up. THIS PICK UP WON'T WORK ON YOUR NYLON STRING GUITAR. That is why I mentioned Godin because you can play 13 pin with nylon string. If you are into guitar synthesizer to play moon light Sonata Piano sound using your Guitar think again. but it is very handy if you are one of those people who likes to right his/her own piece. If you are young and eager go for it . Axon is better although no longer is made specially when the latency is an issue the sound board is no match for Roland controller . This is a good pick up with a part for Les Paul type bridge. but I rather use guitars with single saddle . you see a tiny L shape  part which is 1 mm. this is the most important part of your installation . IT IS 1 mm The distance between string and GK-3 pick up. closer you play one note receive two notes farther sensitivity problem. Therefore , if you use this jack on Les Paul remember IT IS 1 mm how you do it is your creativity. Those people on You tube use a guitar which set by experience technician. Don' expect you do it that easy Detail is the clue, it is exciting. Piano is challenging. my last installation was with Axon controller .I put GK-2a on Les Paul. Axon 101 pick up on Fender full attention to radias and use the L device. after you are done installing put on 20X magnifier to see push the L between string and your pick up . It should go in and out touching the pickup and string without lifting the string. super important. The GK-3 is good. After installing 10-12 of them I am convinced the 1mm and 20 mm distance between saddle and GK pick up are essential.. Keep that in mind, Like I said not that many choices you have. unless you want to install some other Technic such as GHOST graph tech which you can buy it in Amazon. However before making any decision look at your ability to install. Do it professionally cost money. After all this. This GK-3 is the easiest way to get in. Remember your guitar must use steel string magnetic. Now my vote which is a BUY.  Good luck and Happy new year.\", \"I just purchased and received this capo, and have also ordered the G7 capo. Why?

Kaiser Capos work well and I enjoy using them.\\n\\nIf you are looking for other options, check out the Paige, G7 and Shubb.  The benefit of the Kaiser is that it clips on to the headstock when not in use and it has a spring that automatically clips on.\\n\\nShubbs are also well regarded.  They clip on when you lock them.\\n\\nOne of the G7 is really neat as it clips on very easily.  I really like it, but it is expensive.  The Nashville version seems to be more like the Kaiser.\\n\\nThe Paige a very different design and I really like it.  I recommend that you consider that option as you can leave it on the guitar and slide it onto the headstock when not in use.

That said, it is not going to enhance live performances of very loud music, and will work against musicians who depend on distortion and some effects. Put another way,  Hendrix would have hated this device, while Charlie Christian may have sounded even better.\\n\\nIt works by correcting the time shifting of frequency and amplitude that results in envelope distortion. This correction is wonderful for music that depends on vocals, mic-ed acoustic instruments or low volume electronic ones. For studio use this is another tool in the engineer's box. Also, it works exceptionally well as part of the sound system for roots/Americana, traditional blues or jazz ensembles on small stages.\\n\\nThe documentation is concise to the point of being terse. However, in the hands of someone who has some knowledge of sound systems and studio components the highly visual nature of the slim user guide is perfect. And it does convey solid information about various configurations and how this component fits into a signal chain.\\n\\nOverall, it has wider ranging uses in a studio, and is inexpensive enough to be affordable to hobbyists or folks on a budget. The sound enhancement is real, but not as wide ranging for live playing. If you play loud rock or metal and are looking for something to enhance your sound on stage (other than vocals) you may be disappointed. On the other hand, for lower volume music and certainly lightly amplified acoustic instruments, this may make a significant improvement in live performances as well as in the studio.\", \"This item doen't need to be mentioned that much for its quality.

I had tried everything to coax an exciting sound out of that big old box, but these picks finally did it. They were a total revelation: bright, crisp, clean, upfront sound. Easy to hold, fast and slick, they feel good against the strings and boy, do they sing. I use the 73's for flatpicking or digging into blues, and the 60's are great for smoother rhythm playing. Sometimes in a pinch I'll even use a 1.0 on the mandolin, although it's not my first pick, so to speak. Contrary to other reviews citing indestructibility, I have found they do create dust from being shaved against the strings, which is a little strange and a just a tad messy, but it's more than worth it for the sound. My only gripe at this writing: how come the 60's run a buck-fifty more per six pack than the 73's do?  Oh, the injustice.\", 'My favorite picks, these are the best.', 'SUMMARY - if you want to switch between two instruments into one amp, (like 2 guitars ) this solution is pretty much ideal and works very well. If you are switching between amplifiers, you can find better solutions that will potentially be more noise-free, and potentially safer, but they cost more money. Overall, I really like the A or B, A and B switching layout and functionality. This also uses a 9V battery OR a 9V power supply. Prior reviews criticizing lack of easy access to the battery and lack of a 9V input jack are no longer valid -- the product was updated to add an easy access battery door and a \"standard\" 9V jack so you can easily run from your favorite power supply. And the price is right. This is FAR better than the Boss AB-2 that is in the same price range. It lacks a few features that are especially helpful when using this to switch between amplifier inputs.\\n\\nPROs\\n- Relatively small size while still placing the switches far enough apart you are unlikely to hit both when trying to step on only one.\\n- A OR B + A AND B switches\\n- Good bright LED\\'s indicating which outputs are engaged -- this is really important (at least to me)\\n- Use of 9V battery (as opposed to AAA\\'s or something stupid like that. Who would do such a thing? Boss AB-2)\\n- 9V Power supply jack of the \"standard\" variety used on a majority of pedals\\n\\nCONs\\n- Allows bleedthrough of noise from one channel to the other (for instance a high gain pedal on B may bleed noise through to A if the pedal is not turned off)\\n- No ability to change phase - can be a problem if using a Fender 2 channel amp like DRRI with inputs out of phase, or two amps with inputs out of phase.\\n- No ground lift switch to eliminate possible ground loops/hum\\n- No isolation transformer - which can in the worst case result in a shock, or may just result in noise and/or bleedthrough or tone sucking if you have long cables.\\n\\nMY APPLICATION\\nI wanted to use this with a DRRI, (two channel inputs) and put an overdrive or high gain Distortion pedal on channel 1, leaving the reverb and speed/intensity to the clean channel 2. However, when the overdrive is turned on, but the AB is switched to the clean channel, you get a lot of bleed through of the noise inherent from that high gain. It goes away if you switch the pedal off, but that kind of defeats the whole purpose. Also since the inputs on the DRRI are out of phase, the combined signal is a little odd sounding. So this isn\\'t the best choice for my application, although it isn\\'t really a BAD choice...it works to a degree but just has a couple issues. However, I expect I will return this due to the bleedthrough of noise -- the rest I could tolerate but I don\\'t think I can live with that.', \"I picked up a new amp a few months ago, and I decided to try running two amps together. After a bit of research, this pedal seemed to be the best and most economical way to accomplish this. As I expected, I experience a bit of signal loss, but it is so insignificant that I really don't notice it. As a bonus, I realized that there are a lot of very cool things I can do by selecting one amp at a time as well. I have not run it with 2 in and one out, but I assume it would run well in that configuration as well.\\n\\nThis pedal isn't anything fancy, but it does exactly what it should without any fuss, so it's perfect in that way.\", \"I switch between a viola and a violin in a band.

Because it's designed to work across the fretboard, it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets, causing frets to wear faster over time.

The fit was extremely tight(like jamming 2lbs in a 1.5lb bag). Had to jam the headstock in first into the top \"pocket\", then firmly press the body down as it compressed the foam to get it in. Literally, it was a shoe horn fit. Plus, to get it out, I had to make a coat hanger hook to grab the endtail piece(strap hook)  & pull quite hard to get it out(without damaging the guitar finish).\\n\\nThis case is the 940-EDREAD & fits the AJ-100 & /CE like a glove.

It\\'s heavy(wood), extremely sturdy(exactly like Les Paul cases) & with 5 gold clasps could very well be air an tight seal. Inside is soft plush material & perfect grade foam, exactly what you expect from Epiphone. It\\'s much like the Gibson Les Paul case I had. One locking clasp that comes with one key(don\\'t lose it).\\n\\nIt is nearly twice as heavy as the ABS Gator case. It wraps the guitar body perfectly all the way around & the neck girdle locks it in. There is nothing around the headstock to bump the machine heads so you won\\'t knock your guitar out of tune putting it away or taking it out. There are also several inches above the headstock so it will take a longer guitar or you can make a custom pocket.\\n\\nEpiphone\\'s fitment chart states this is the case for the DR-212. That is 90% true. The DR-212 headstock fits with several inches to spare, the neck girdle will hold the DR\\'s much thicker neck, DR body width is the same but it is narrower than the AJ. The bottom of the DR touches the foam but has about 1/2\" around the sides allowing it to swing around like a clock pendulum. With the lid closed & shaking the case I could detect no movement so the lid puts enough pressure on the bridge to hold the DR in place.

All in all, a fun little item.\", 'good', 'Some history on this device: The Alesis SR-16 has been in production since 1991 and has gone through only slight revisions to the hardware since its original release. The 16-bit drum samples are still the same today as they were on this unit over 15 years ago. It is regarded as a break-through piece of studio gear and regarded by many studio engineers as the first rhythm machine capable of producing a convincing enough drum track capable of replacing a real drummer in studio recordings for rock applications. (Prior to the SR-16, rhythm machines were commonly used in pop music in the 80\\'s, but it was always clear to trained ears that a rhythm machine was used, the SR-16 successfully blurred the line and made it possible to use rhythm machines in genres that generally frowned upon electronic drums such as: rock, country and blues) You\\'ll hear the SR-16 on many professional tracks by top name recording artist from the early to mid-90\\'s.\\n\\nToday the SR-16 can still be found in many professional and home recording studios. With the emergence of Pro Tools and other PC based Digital Audio Workstations, stand alone rhythm machines have become much less popular today in pro recording, but they are still very popular in home studios and for performing solo musicians around the world.\\n\\nComparing the SR-16 to newer products: Rhythm machines produced by Roland/BOSS, Yamaha and ZOOM are the SR-16\\'s primary competition, with Roland and Alesis often cited as leaders and innovators in pro electronic percussion (these companies also produce the best quality electronic kits and the same samples are used in their rhythm machine products). Some of the features common to newer rhythm machines not found on the SR-16 include: 24-bit samples, more memory, bass guitar sequencer ability to store MIDI files on device.\\n\\nEase of use: Aside from its convincing sound quality, perhaps the reason the SR-16 has remained in production and a favorite among musicians is its ease of use. The SR-16 was designed with the non-drummer solo musician in mind and is considered one of the easiest rhythm machines to program. It\\'s interface has been copied (but many would say not trumped) by BOSS, Yamaha and others. The manual, while poorly edited does more than any other rhythm machine owners guide to cater to solo musician who doesn\\'t understand the first thing about sequencing drum tracks and it\\'s A,FillA,B,FillB pattern foot switch configuration makes it easier to improvise with... In short, you don\\'t get much customization with the SR-16, but what you do get feature was is going to be the most popular setup which makes the device much more approachable than many modern rhythm machines and sequencer options. Has a full MIDI in/out through implementation so the SR-16 can be patched in and controlled from DAW\\'s (Pro Tools, Cubase, Live, etc...)\\n\\nComparing generations: If you\\'re buying previously owned model be aware that some features have changed over the years. First generation SR-16 models (1991-circa 2001) had about 1/2 of the user memory than that of the current production SR-16. Also, the first generation units did not have a headphone jack. In the early 2000\\'s Alesis updated all the preset patterns creating a market for \"vintage\" SR-16 machines. Also, over the years the price has dropped significantly. The SR-16 was originally marketed as a high-end studio product with a price tag around $400. While the quality of the unit has only improved, the price has dropped as computer parts have become less expensive (also newer units are mass produced in Asia).', \"I pick these picks all day long.

I looked at the manual very closely and somehow figured out how to set up a basic song.\\n\\nI think what was confusing to me was that the machine has two data banks, one for preset patterns and the other for user patterns.  User patterns have a lot of preset patterns, so that was a bit confusing to me.  When I created a new pattern, it went all the way after the preset patterns in the user pattern section.  I felt like new patterns disappeared.\\n\\nWhy are there preset patterns in the user pattern???  Conceptually, this doesn't make sense.\\n\\nI deleted the first 10 present patterns stored in the user data, which created rooms for my patterns.  This made it easy to find patterns I made.\\n\\nWhile I tried to create new patterns and a song, I keep losing what I just programmed.  This was because I was not using SAVE/COPY button correctly (it works just like SAVE or SAVE AS in MS-WORD).  What I still don't know is how to know which pad to push to delete a certain sound unless it is an obvious one like a bass drum.  If I hear something I don't like (say, one of the percussion drums or bass notes), I don't know the name of the instrument or the notes and I wouldn't know which pad to push to delete it.  I have to push pads randomly to find out what it is and I think it gets confusing.  I'm hoping to find an answer to this question on the community forum.  I rated this product originally with three stars, but I added one more star to be fair.  I was able to figure this all out in a matter of couple of hours when I really really tried to read the manual and felt determined.

I definitely expected higher quality control from EH. I've read that this pedal works a lot better with an active instrument. I happen to have a passive bass, and the sound is far from ideal.\\n\\nThat said, I still find a use for the pedal (I only paid $100 for it, though). It gives a lot of flexibility with tone shaping and it interacts well with my distortion pedal. It definitely colors your tone, but not very significantly.

It does seem to add some warmth to my hybrid amp (tube pre, trans. power).  It has not driven my MXR Super Comp out of my chain though, and is not the miraculous tone maker that some seem to describe...almost like its alchemy!  Seems reviews are over the top bad or good as they are written after first impression.  This pedal does little to affect your sound...which can be a good thing with compression.

I have a full computer recording setup with high quality drum plugins but I still love the vibe and hands-on immediacy of a good old-fashioned groove box, and the SR-18 does not disappoint.  It sounds better than I expected, with a good selection of surprisingly decent acoustic kits, but it\\'s those deliciously dated kits and samples I actually like the most.  My philosophy is, if you\\'re going to use a standalone drum machine these days, embrace its mechanical nature and look to software if realism is what you\\'re after.\\n\\nMy favorite features:\\nFully customizable drum kits.  You can either edit a factory kit or start fresh by choosing from an awesome selection of basic samples and then tweaking volume, pitch, panning, envelope and other parameters to taste.  Super flexible.\\nMultiple parts/fills.  For each sequence you get an A part, B part and a corresponding fill for each.\\nRecord a song live.  In song mode you can hit record and the unit will capture your pattern changes and fills in real time, making it fun and easy to arrange entire songs.  I much prefer this style of arranging to the tedious and time consuming step editing song mode of other machines, though that mode is still an option here if you prefer that workflow.\\n\\nDeeply customizable.  I like how much control you get over every aspect of the machine, including very extensive midi settings which is great for me since I\\'m using this in conjunction with other synths and sequencers\\nOnboard effects.  They aren\\'t anything fancy but the eq and compression effects are very useful.  There are only a few useful reverb settings but those few sound good and are nice to have on hand.\\n\\nDrawbacks:\\nThere are a few drawbacks keeping me from giving the SR-18 five stars but they\\'re minor and by no means deal breakers.\\nNo USB.  This machine was released in the late 2000s as an update to it\\'s predecessor, the SR-16.  It really seems like oversight that they didn\\'t include a USB port for midi communication and firmware updates.  It\\'s not a big problem but should have been a no-brainer\\nDoesn\\'t automatically save.  If you\\'re editing a pattern, song or kit and you turn off the machine without saving, your work is lost.  It should save your work automatically and perhaps provide an undo function if you need to reverse any mistakes\\nSettings don\\'t always save.  Some of my record settings and system settings seem to get lost when I tirn off the unit.  This could be user error but the manual isn\\'t clear if you need to manually save settings or not.  Again, this should be automatic\\nNo dedicated \"exit\" button.  It\\'s easy to get buried in a menu and not quite know what mode the machine is in.  It would help to have a dedicated cancel or exit button that gets you completely out of whatever context you\\'re in\\nPad response.  I find that I really have to pound on the pads to get higher velocities from them, and it shouldn\\'t be that difficult.  They should have included a setting for pad sensitivity so this could be tailored to the user\\'s playing style.  Perhaps the pads will get \"broken in\" over time as I continue to play on them\\nLow output level.  The line outputs are pretty quiet compared to the output of all my other line-level instrumens.  An option to boost the output level would be nice.  I have to boost it on my mixer instead\\n\\nOverall I\\'m in love with this little box and for the price and what it is you really get a ton of samples, kits, beats and options.  It is also just plain fun!  I can spend hours tapping out beats, tweaking kits and arranging songs.  It is really helping as a songwriting tool because you can organize all your parts, even with bass lines, and then jam over it on guitar or keys to get ideas and try things out.  Overall I highly recommend the SR-18', 'Great strings. The quality you expect, but a nice warm sound that really adds to the sound of lower-quality guitars.', \"Martin tries to save a dime by putting String 1 & 4 in one package...etc. 2 strings per sleeves. Not a big deal since the sleeves are labeled with which strings are in each. Right? Wrong. I like the quality and sounds but buyer beware. They put the wrong strings in the sleeves.

From the time I opened the box until I finally figured out how to make simple changes, I have spent three weeks in trial and error and handwrote a dozen pages of my own notes, tables, and instructions, just so I can use the SR16 adequately. I have not even attempted to create anything new and cannot imagine the nightmare it would be. This has been a frustrating experience, to say it respectfully. The reasons I plowed through all this frustration were 1) customer ratings and comments, 2) the lack of a reasonably priced competitive drum machines, and 3) the sounds were actually good enough for my limited use (Im a guitarist).\\nOther shortcomings:\\n1)  there are no options for drum intros and extros\\n2) you cannot throw in a drum fills randomly which is very restrictive during a live, spontaneous performance when you cannot keep track of which beat you're on (the SR16 accepts two foot pedals)\\n3) the display is not backlit and is difficult to read under low light conditions as youd expect in a performance\\n4) some buttons are dual function but unlabeled, some buttons are toggle, some are momentary, some are single function; you just have to memorize which does what\\n5) no trouble shooting guide\\n6) a step-reference users chart inconveniently affixed underneath the SR16 instead of printed in the Reference Guide or as a separate card\\nIm giving the SR16 a rating of one star because, although a great sounding drum machine, it is useless if you cannot use it. The instructions barely bridge the gap between a great machine and a great useable machine. Unless you have plenty of undisturbed time, lots of patience, and undeterred to writing copious notes, I would not recommend this $150 machine for you.\", \"I now use this amazing drum machine as my default effect engine for my live gigs. I use a DrumKat 3.0 as drum pads thru Midi and it just sounds great. So flexible and easy to program. I'm very happy with my purchase. I had the SR16 in the past but this one is even better.

I didn't like the SR-18 at all.\\n\\nI've tried every drum machine ever made, and I always come back to this one.  The sounds are clunky and dull compared to more modern machines, but for a quick jam, you can't beat it.  It's quick and easy to dial in a beat and a tempo, and the two foot pedals make a live performance almost plausible.  If that's how you play, I recommend this highly.  If you want to program an entire song and let it play for a set duration, there are better choices.  But for laying down a beat in a minimum of time and still having the capability to mix it up with two patterns a some fills, this is the one to get.  Let me add the I bought and returned the updated SR18.  It sounds better, but I found the beats less useful and some were downright weird.  Pretty much the same experience with the BeatBuddy, though I still have it and use it when I have the time and patience.  I wish Alesis would just update this one, give us better sounds and a few more beats, but retain the ease of use.\", 'Old school Alesis always end up being the drum kit on my tracks.

As an aside, I\\'ve had a Alesis machine that is 8 years old.. stayed on most of the time and is still working but showing signs of \"old age\" however it still works but the volume is down and I have to yank up the recording volume for recording...

Huge difference!\", \"I always buy D'Addario strings from Amazon. My last amazon order I bought different brands to see if they are better. These strings come doubled up in a 3 pack envelope. They are very long and they go on easily.  I have a UT you can find out there to hear how these sound and my initial impression.  So my true thoughts. I won't buy these again.  I might try another Martin item but not these. I bought the .011 size for my acoustic.  IF you finger pick then these strings are EXCELLENT.  I was using steel and silk before and switching to these was wonderful.  There is a String to grab your nail on to compared to steel and silk. That is what I love about this item.  For finger picking it has beautiful sound and is a joy to play.  Playing with the pad of my thumb also sounds good but not great.  Using my thumb nail or a pick and these strings ring like a tinny brassy sound that makes my guitar sound like a toy. D'addario EJ13 from amazon never do this.  10 minutes after putting them on I wanted to take them off- but I will play them out for a month or two until I can't handle it anymore.  Look here for the EJ13 http://www.amazon.com/DAddario-EJ13-Bronze-Acoustic-Strings/dp/B0031ZF4Q6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430884490&sr=8-1&keywords=ej13\", \"These are the best... light gauge and they ring like a bell... my 12-string sounds better than ever before, and I don't have to use a pair of vice grips to play it.\", \"They're OK.

When you want to put your chops to the test it's nice to be able to play along with a beat that you choose. Now this is more than enough for me but you can program for all sorts of your own stuff and more. You can't go wrong buying and using this and you'll wonder how you managed to play without it.  The price is good so that's not an issue and so far it's doing what I ask.\", 'NICE MACHINE', 'As others have said, the instructions for this machine are quite complicated, but mostly that\\'s because it is capable of doing so much. I am fairly intelligent, with several college degrees, but only a fair amount of electronic technical knowledge and experience. I wanted a simple way to use this drum machine to enhance my solo playing, and it took me several sessions to pore over the technical explanations for all the ways the machine can be used.\\n\\nI only want to use pre-existing patterns and modify them slightly, mostly the tempo and then just activate that using the footswitch and stop it the same way. I know this doesn\\'t produce the most professional results and doesn\\'t exactly match up with all the nuances of a song, but I just don\\'t have the patience to program the drum and bass parts for each song individually. Added to this is that I may not play the song exactly the same way every time. There may be slight variations in my performance, and I embrace these, as that is part of live music.\\n\\nI finally deciphered how to do this and to save (record) my \"songs\"--really just pre-set patterns with the tempo modified, and to name them so I can play any song I want by just selecting the song from my list. It may not be perfect, but it works for me and I\\'m not a technician, and don\\'t really want a technician for live performances at small clubs and parties. I want a drummer and an unobtrusive bass player, and that is what I get with the Alesis SR 18. I can select the drum set I want and the type of bass, and can even transpose the key for the bass, but so far all I have done is select these as default settings so that all my songs use the same kit. It\\'s fine for me and my limited use.\\n\\nThe sound, though, is much superior to the Zoom RT 223 I had been using. That machine has more patterns (over 400), but fewer usable ones, and some that were really annoying. The Alesis has just 100 patterns in the \"A\" list, and slight variations of those in the \"B\" list, and some fairly subtle fills that you can activate with the dual footswitch. These usually are in and out, meaning it will lead into a change (for instance into a bridge) and then out of that bridge and back into the main part of the song. I use them sparingly. Mostly I stick to start and stop once I\\'ve selected and modified the pattern for my song.\\n\\nI know this is an anti-technical way to use this machine, but it works for me, and I suspect will work for others who don\\'t want to spend all their music time programming a machine, but prefer to play with some reasonable accompaniment that is easy to access.\\n\\nTo sum up, it is a great sounding machine with immense technical possibilities, and it takes some effort to decipher the instructions, especially if you, like me, are interested mainly in an easy to use, good sounding drum and bass backup.', 'How many music consumer goods that were released in 1990 are still being produced today in their original 1990 form?

I\\'ve been playing for about two years, and not very heavily, and that was enough to build up sufficient calluses. People without calluses will hate these strings at first, though. I can no longer show friends how to fret a guitar chord when these strings are in, because they start saying \"ow\" within 10 seconds or so.\\n\\nThe sound is also a little different than what I was used to. I was hoping to get something brighter that will cut through a crowd of banjos and out onto a busy loud dance floor. They do that just fine! They have a high overtone in them that is very bright and almost tinny. It\\'s not a sound for everyone, and I wouldn\\'t go for it myself if I just wanted to quietly strum in an empty parlor. For hillbilly hoedowns, though, it\\'s just fine, even though it took some getting used to.\\n\\nThe low E string is exceptionally big. I didn\\'t know a star off, because this is probably the fault of my guitar\\'s setup, but I find it harder to get a good ring out of the low E string now.

I finally figured out that the drum machine was hindering my creative process and not helping it, so I figured the best thing to do would be to upgrade with the same company, since I dug the sr-16.\\n\\nthe sr-18, while it has many of the same features as the 16, which means you can get this and set up tracks the same way, the sound of this drum machine is so much better you will feel like you've been robbing yourself of a quality drum machine. in fact, other than being able to be critical of the snare sounds available, though they are okay to good to great, there isn't much to complain about this device. I don't like the bass and sounds on the included drum beats, since some of them sound good, but you have a silly bassline dictating the key, boo, there is a way to cut that out I think but I forget how, lol.\\n\\nUPDATE: they made taking out the drum/percussion/ or BASS sound out of a pattern VERY EASY. you play one of the pre programmed beats, and hit MUTE, then the thing you want cut out, in this case the BASS, since some of the beats sounded really good, I wanted to take the bass out to just start jamming over drum sounds. so they made it easier than I thought. the manual is very much worth reading and the more you can learn about this thing, the more you can do with it. you could treat it like an sr 16 with better sound, and that's fine, but they have added plenty of cool stuff like the effects and other things, that make it worth learning how to use to its fullest\\n\\nthere are some great drum pad sounds, and a much better electronic drum selection. to compare this to the akai wouldn't be fair since that is waaaay more for hip hop and r and b, while this one is more for rock and dance and stuff, they are kind of geared to opposite people. if you play guitar and are into music like that, this is the better choice, plus if you are into electronic music, there are some cool sounds too, though most people making that music have tons of options with computers and software like fruity loops and all that stuff. so this is the upgrage for guitarists and bedroom musicians that want to create music with better sounding drums. I am re reading the manual I got offline and while it is more or less easy to create a pattern, I am reading it again to really get the most out of it, since there is a lot you can do with it.\\n\\nit is very much worth the money and if you have an sr-16, GET THIS ONE ASAP.\", 'Works like advertied', \"No need to buy those pricy D'addario strings.

As it happens, the bass sounds are not much use unless you have a MIDI keyboard to use with them. For example, if you make a song by chaining several patterns together, you have to record every single freakin' bass note, over all the key changes.

Very highly recommend that you get two footswitches for it. I have two different kinds of pedals so is visually easy to tell which start/stop and which switches between A to B. If you have a multieffect pedal that takes MIDI CLOCK in, is very cool to set that option and have the Drum machine send tempo controls.

BUT, I have been using the SR16 for over 15 years and used the HR16 before it since the 80s.  As some have said, right away you can hear the improvement in the sound, not that the SR16 sounded bad... but this sounds great.  I have yet to build my own patterns with this but I see all the familiar buttons to do that, so I suspect it will be very similar to the SR16, which was easy to use, though certainly time consuming to build the patterns, but thats ok.  I have gone through about 10 of the patterns so far only because I plugged in my guitar and jammed on each one.  Here are the early thoughts:  Number 1, if you are a guitarist who has to jam alone a lot, you are going to absolutely love this thing because of the fact that you can get some really nice drum and bass going on at the same time.  The pads that give you the drums also give you the notes for the bass for you to program that.  Each of the patterns I whipped through took me into different guitar ideas and such, same as jamming with a live drummer and bassist would do.  It was fun... and, you know, if you ever have to spontaneously just play SOMETHING for someone it kinda sucks when there is only guitar unless you are a world class guitarist.  With this, you get the drums and bass along with you and it makes what you do sound more interesting.  Number 2, I think the existing patterns are pretty cool for jamming, but they seem a bit busy for recording... so look at this drum machine as a tool in that its greatest use out of the box is jamming... and then you get the bonus of having the ability to program it for song demos.  I have a real drumset and mics and processors and let me tell you trying to record good sounding acoustic drums is a nightmare.  In the end the better sounds of a good drum machine, while not always as organic as you'd like still lead to a better sounding demo most of the time compared to live drums in a home demo situation.  Number 3, reiterating Number 1, if you are a guitarist or keyboardist... really... the ability to have bass involved as well as drums is AWESOME.  I thought the bass would just be a nice little bonus.. its done better than that to make it more than a little thing.  I read many reviews on here of people downplaying the bass feature saying they would record their own bass.  I agree with them... when recording, you would.  But... for simple fun and jamming... this rocks.\\n\\nMy SR16 is still going strong.  The only reason I really got this one is because I thought it might be fun to keep one drum machine by my recording unit and one by my keyboard amp for quick live jamming (its no fun always having to unplug and reconnect in different spots) and then I searched Amazon for drum machines and saw Alesis had put out this newer model that I was never aware of.  I would say, for any guitarist, its hard to spend $200 and get a tool/toy better than this!  Now the trouble is I will want the SR18 in both locations.  If you are not sure whether the SR18 is worth the extra cost from the SR16, TRUST ME... it IS!!!\\n\\nI will update the review in the future if I have anything significant to add... but in an hour or so of jamming, I already think this has proven to be a fantastic purchase!\", \"I have a real drum set at home and all the VSTs I could ever use on my computer, but I often play live and sometimes I don't have a real drummer available. I need flexibility live, so canned backing drums won't cut it. This unit does what I need at a reasonable price.  I'd never record with it and usually don't even arrange full songs with it, but the ability to do A/B patterns, fills, and stop/start with foot switches allows me to extend or cut songs on the fly.\\n\\nThere's plenty of sounds and kits and options to tweak. If you can't make this sound good, you're not trying. I cut my teeth years ago with a Sequential Circuits Drumtrax and an Alesis HR16 and I don't find the SR18 difficult to use. You will probably need to read the manual and keep it handy for reference, but I can't imagine any modern drum machine being much easier to use.\\n\\nI haven't used the bass option, so I can't comment on it.  It would be nice if it was off by default, rather than having to turn it off every time I turn on the unit, but that's minor.\", \"Yes, I'm using the title of a Cars song for this review, but my feelings are true. I was messing around in a used guitar store playing my Fender bass through my Hartke LH1000 and the store's used Hartke Hydrive 810 that I've been checking out; making a lot of noise, when one of the store attendants told me to turn it down so they could hear the phone calls that were coming in. So, I took a break, looking around, and asked about drum machines. They showed me the Alesis SR16, explained how it worked, gave me a 10% discount and I left the store for home.\\n\\nThis thing is so easy to work with. I created a song within hours using the AABA method with no problem. The only reason I haven't gave this thing a 5 star rating is because I just bought it and I may be suffering from over-excitement, but for $80.00 I feel like a got a deal AND, this machine is Just What I Needed.\\n\\nWill keep you posted on further results...\\n\\n7/14/12\\n\\nI'm still diggin this machine.

Having a structured thought to follow and using Fills at the right time are things that make the drumming believable.

A lot of new players go for multi effects pedals - and those can be great, but there is a steep learning curve, and can be a very expensive option.  Start with a good chorus like this one, and then add others when your budget (and your experience) let you!', 'Sweet singing chorus! Solid Boss construction. I love it!', 'Nice Pedal. Good Deal. Thanks.', \"People either really seem to love or hate this pedal. Haters tend to call it cold and sterile sounding. I suppose that compared to a vintage Boss CE-1 or EHX Small Clone, the tone of the CH-1 is not as lush or liquid (sorry, probably the two most over-used adjectives when it comes to chorus) sounding. I don't think that's the tone the designers of this pedal were going for, though. To me, the CH-1 sounds best for adding a little extra thickness and dimension to clean tones rather than slathering on the chorus effect. The CH-1, in my experience, blends very well with distortion, which makes it a great choice for lead work and getting those cool mid-era Alex Lifeson Rush tones.\\n\\nI tend to favor a thicker, lusher, more vintage sounding chorus for clean tones. However, this pedal really shines when combined with medium to high gain tones. The tone doesn't disintegrate or get too mushy. The highs aren't icepick bright.

After a day or so of getting of the learning curve it was very straight forward.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that I wish \"velocity\" could influence pitch.  Maybe it can but I have not figured that out.', \"I've had an SR-16 for years.  Loved it; used it regularly.  I loved it so much, I started writing Alesis about 10 years ago, asking them to update the sounds to 16-bit.  I bought the SR-18 the day it came out.  Now I'm going to Ebay it.\\n\\nI need a drum machine for practice.  With a couple of foot pedals, you can run the SR-16 while you and the other guitarists do your thing.  Stop, start, decent fills that are completely logical and predictable.\\n\\nBut the SR-18 is just about worthless in that role.  Yeah, it sounds gorgeous, but it's just unusable as a live-performance tool.  I mean, maybe it's OK if you want to program every single song you do, but to just start it and jam on a song, forget it.  Here are some of the weird things:\\n\\nGenres not grouped together.  Wouldn't you expect one click to take you from Rock 1 to Rock 2?  Not so.  If you're looking for a rock beat, you have to look all over the list to find the next one.\\n\\nDifferent tempos for each pattern.  So. . .you're playing along a 130 bpm but you decide you need a slightly different rhythm.  You dial in a different pattern and wham, you're suddenly playing at 210 bpm.  What's with that??\\n\\nDifferent track lengths for each pattern.  On the old SR-16, all patterns were 2 bars; eight beats.  Boring, maybe, but useful and predictable.  It was easy to insert a fill because you knew what was coming.  On the SR-18, some patterns are 16 beats, some are 8, some are 20. . .I forget.  But there you are, jamming along and you go to the Fill function to bring you to the chorus. . .and it starts the fill 8 beats too late.  Sheesh.  With the SR-16 I got so good, I could just tap my footswitch and get a single cymbal crash at the end of a phrase.  Not possible now. . .at least, not without years of study.\\n\\nSo: this machine is probably swell if you intend to program each song you do--and play it exactly the same way each time.  If, like me, you used the SR-16 for practice, for extending a jam while your lead guitarist got his act together, for a quick simple beat that did the job most of the time. . .save your money.  Stick with your old SR-16.  That's what I'm doing.  Alesis, you broke my heart!  Why couldn't you just give us the same great functionality of the SR-16, but with better sounds?\", 'The Alesis SR18 Drum Machine is amazing. I have had many problems with every computer based drum machine program. It\\'s not that they didn\\'t work right, but the fact that they just weren\\'t for me. I am very good with computers, do photography editing, and music editing, etc, all on the few computers I own. As far as doing drums on my computer, It just wasn\\'t clicking. Everyone has to find their path of least resistance, and THEIR best method for doing things, since everybody is different and everyone has their own path of least resistance. Hence, to each, their own. What works best and is the easiest for one person, may be the most complicated for the other. What is most complicated for you, may be the easiest for the other person.\\n\\nBasically what I am saying is this drum machine, once in my hands, really clicked. This was MY path of least resistance. It\\'s good to know I can sit down with this machine, and only this machine, and make full drum tracks. As far as some people saying this is so hard to use, or takes a couple months, for me it took two days. Hence, 6 one way, half dozen the other. The first day I just messed with it, without directions. It was confusing. The second day, I read the directions, and by the end of the second day, I had already made three full length drum tracks, doing everything from customizing my entire drum set and sounds, making a bunch of patterns, and then piecing all those patterns together to make tracks.\\n\\nOk, so now for what it can do:\\n* I saw one review where they said you cannot change the length of the patterns. This is not true. You CAN indeed change the length of the patterns. You can use whatever tempo you want, 120, 140, whatever, and you can make the patterns 4 beats long, or 8, or 16, etc.\\n* You can customize your own drum setup, so you have have a couple bass, etc. Rule of thumb if you are trying to re-create double bass, is to make two sounds, almost identical, BUT make the second sound a little different tonewise. Because in real life, you can tell the difference between both bass drums. This makes it sound more realistic.\\n* There are a TON of different sound variations for every kind of drum sound you want.\\n* You can tweak each individual sound. For instance, if I find a crash I like, but think to myself that I want it to sound softer, offset it to the right a little, change the pitch to a slightly lower pitch, and also make it ring on longer, ALL of this is possible.\\n* Learning this machine really is not that hard. Can be done within a good weekend.\\n\\nAll in all, this machine is amazing. I am a heavy metal guitarist, and I record my own tracks on a Tascam DP-02, and this works great in conjunction with that. This machine works very well with the metal genre, or rock, or any genre at all. It lets me put together full length tracks (from all of my combined patterns I made), does very very well using it in a double bass aspect (you can program the bass to sound like double bass, and as fast as you want), and you end up with very realistic sounding drum tracks! Since I play metal, this is VERY important, since it\\'s hard to find a good drum machine that can go with the metal genre. Last, all I have to do is plug it into my Tascam recorder, and record! Love it! This sounds amazing!\\n\\nThe one and ONLY downside to this is the fact that there is NO connection to connect it to your computer. I want to make this clear. There is a way to hook up through your instrument cable connections, but then I\\'m not sure how this hooks to your computer through a 1/4\" cable connection. But all I have to do is record them into my Tascam, then send them to my computer, where I can save them for later.\\n\\nHope this helps, and sorry about rambling. Any questions, feel free to comment and I will surely answer them for you the best I can, to help out.', \"Our son has been taking lessons for a couple years and his teacher suggested replacing the strings on his Yamaha acoustic guitar to get a warmer, bluesy sound to match the songs that our son currently really likes to play.\\n\\nThe teacher recommended Martin strings for this guitar, and we purchased this set without a hitch.  Even though our son's fingers have toughened nicely, his teacher said that these would still take a bit of getting used... and that advice was right on the mark.\\n\\nThe sound these string produce is amazing; you can clearly hear his playing from anywhere in the house, and that is really nice.

Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects.  This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much.

Walking in on Sunday morning and turn out some Slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts.

Using the wrong cable with a high-impedance guitar amp will cause your trebles to get muddy, and as you move around, the cable will act like a microphone, amplifying every slink and slap against the stage through your speakers.\\n\\nAny two pieces of metal (such as the two wires inside a cord) will act as a capacitor. The tone control on a guitar is just a capacitor wired in series with a volume pot. If your guitar cord is a good capacitor, you\\'ll find that turning down the volume on your guitar just murders your highs. This cord is well-made, from an electrical standpoint, and even on a cheap guitar like my Squier, holds on to the highs as you lower the instrument volume.\\n\\nAt the high impedances found on (especially cheaper and older) guitars, cables also act like electret microphones as the conductors rattle around inside the shield. The conductive vinyl cladding indeed does bleed off extra charge that accumulates inside the shield (tribocharging), and minimizes mechanical noise.\\n\\nFancier, more expensive cables from Monster and Mogami are no more advanced in their design than this, and while I\\'m sure they perform measurably better (as they claim to), there is an important difference between \"measurable\" and \"audible.\" You want some money left over to buy strings and beer.

I am posting this just for those who might be looking for more of a clean tone for music genre other than blues.  This mic is designed to distort the sound and that\\'s exactly what you want for Chicago Blues, but not what you want for just about anything else.  A high quality instrument mic (either small diaphragm condenser, or lavaliere condenser type) will generally provide the cleanest tone and widest frequency range, and a dynamic vocal mic will give you something fairly clean, but with a little bias toward mid range frequency at the expense of less high frequency response (still way better high frequency stuff than a bullet mic though).  Also note that while guitar-type tube amps are again exactly what you want for blues, You will want to substitute a P.A. type of amp/speaker(s) or active speaker(s) for clean tones.  Listen to some harmonica performances on Youtube, and if you want that \\'bluesy\" kind of thing, get this mic, if you want something closer to the stuff more typically played on a chromatic (whether you intend to play it on chromatic or diatonic), get an instrument mic or a vocal mic.

Get a Fireball V.', \"I just engineered a recording using a 520dx for vocals and it came out great.\\n\\nThe mic gave the vocals a slight megaphone tone, but not too much that it approached a compressed telephone type of sound.

Obviously it isn't the best vocal mic, you can drop thousands on a Neumann if you want a killer vocal mic, but for some creative applications this mic is great.\\n\\nA little unwieldy perhaps, but not too heavy, and built solid. Drop this mic as many times as you will (it's going to happen) and worry not. You could hammer nails in with this.\", \"3.5 is perfect for classical soprano. If you're on 3 on alto this is ideal.

I'm still trying new strings looking for the right sound for me, latest I've gotten are the coated Martins.  They are also a tad thin sounding.  I had some strings at one time that were more full sounding, can't remember what they were!  So, I'm searching.\\nIf you like the sound of these, they are well made.  It's a matter of taste.\", 'I really like the mediums.  They are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being to heavy or not durable enough.', 'These were purchased for my sons guitar. He loves them. I plan on buying him another set of them for Christmas.', \"I've been playing with these strings for several years now, and I absolutely love them to death. First heard of using medium-gauge phosphor-bronze strings after looking up that Elliott Smith used them on an old, cheap Yamaha guitar. I couldn't believe it. His strings had such an incredibly bassy, warm tone to them that I assumed it had more to do with mic quality or placement, but no, amazingly, it really is just the strings.\\n\\nBesides the tone, the heavier gauge also allows for a few perks while playing. For one, they're so thick that you sort of have to try to knock them out of tune, and they endure the general wear-and-tear of constant playing far better than lighter-gauge strings. Secondly, as with any heavier gauge, they resonate more, and that translates into sheer volume. If you slammed your pick down on strings like these in an apartment, there is absolutely no doubt that all of your neighbors would hear you loudly and clearly. Of course, this also means that you can fingerpick without using your nails and still get a very pleasant, subdued, medium-volume tone. Honestly, light-gauge steel strings sound almost tinny to me by comparison.\\n\\nThe biggest and perhaps only problem with these, as others have pointed out, is that, yes, they hurt. If you're new to guitar, I would really not recommend them until you at least have very solid callouses on every finger. I play guitar every day for at least an hour, and my hand still has a tendency to go slightly numb from using these. In fact, even switching guitars and playing lighter, steel strings and coming back to these makes me feel like a complete beginner, when even fretting a chord would sting until it burned. And, just like with when I was new at guitar, you get used to it, and stop noticing as much, but still: a word of caution.\\n\\nOverall, these are my absolute favorite strings for their warm, rich, incredibly loud tone, and their amazing longevity. If those are more important to you than anything else, string-wise, I would definitely recommend giving these a try.\", 'I am happy I bought these strings for my son.  He seemed to be very happy with them.  I got them for him for Christmas along with another kind.

I cannot believe how amazing these strings sound. I\\'m not even kidding when I tell you that it sounds as if I purchased a brand new guitar. Like I mentioned, I\\'m much more into drumming, so some of you actual guitarists might read this and be like \"Well um, duh, obviously new strings make it sound better, just like new drum heads make your drums sound better!\" But honestly, I\\'m not just talking about how it made it sound better by just changing them, it brought the guitar to life. I\\'ve had a few different types of acoustic strings on this in the past (tried different kinds over the years).

On that type of mouthpiece, I find the more conventional Vandoren reeds to be too bright sounding, and actually greatly prefer the Javas for classical playing.

Some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics. If you strum harder, they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent, changing the tone for the same reason a \"bend\" would. If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one.\\n\\nOn the other hand, compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound, the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good.\\n\\nDepending on your style, these might be a good choice. If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable, these might seem more at home.  If you are used to Martin medium strings, but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things, you might like these too, but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings, you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t say I dislike these, and I wouldn\\'t quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them, because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs.

It is especially good at reproducing the sound of the low E string, which the other pickups don't handle nearly as well. Finger picking, strumming, whatever, this thing sounds great! I did try it on a 12-string and was not as impressed, but that is really a different animal and shouldn't be held against it. Highly recommended!\", \"I make my living with a guitar in my hands, and this pickup is simply great! I've used it for several years now, in a variety of rooms and situations, and it always delivers realistic acoustic tone. With the blend control, you can pretty easily deal with feedback if the acoustics of the room aren't optimum. The more of the mic that you can dial in, the better, in large areas, but even the magnetic pickup alone is leagues ahead of all the other acoustic pickups I've used. Top of the line Martin and Taylor on-board systems included. The mic placement/adjustment inside the guitar is hugely influential. You really have to take some time to find the sweet spot in whichever guitar you mount it in, but again, used in conjunction with the blend control, it's not hard to find a really nice sound. I've never had any problem with the mic moving around.\\n  This pickup is definitely adequate for recording, but a quality small condenser aimed at the 12th fret is really hard to beat... The overall bandwidth is impressive, with HUGE bass possible, especially in open D tuning, and clean, clear highs at the same time. The string balance is also very good.\\n  I use this now in a 00 sized solid Spruce/Rosewood guitar, and have had it in a Martin HD-28, Martin and Fender 12 strings, and a couple other solid wood acoustics. I couldn't imagine playing an acoustic gig without this pickup. It is an essential tool for me.\", 'Great pickup, combined with the Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. you will have an excellent experience.

I installed some Fishman \"under the saddle\" pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good, if not better.

I have used soundhole pickups, under-saddle pickups (which I hate as they never sound like a real guitar). Previously I was using an internal gooseneck condenser mic with adequate results, but found the sound a bit thin when i used effects. Using a Taylor 510, in a huge church through a mixer into the PA system. Switching to the Fishman was like night and day; was able to dial a blend easily to give my sound some nice full bottom without sacrificing treble. I also found that when i used effects, dialing to the magnetic pickup gave better results. A previous reviewer complained about the mic position; I find it is in an optimal position and have not felt the need to move it; in fact my old gooseneck was annoying because it would eventually drift into a position that was either too much bass or too much treble. I have never felt the need to move the Fishman mic at all.\\nI decided to retire my Taylor, and have now moved and play in a Church about one fifth the size of the other. I now use an Epiphone Masterbilt 500 (all solid wood, mahogany and spruce), and the pickup continues to be stunning. As I said I much prefer this to an undersaddle piezo; undersaddle combos just seem to \"boingy\" or \"twangy\" and less natural to me; with the Fishman blend, I get plenty of bottom from the magnetic pickup without sacrificing a realistic, woody tone.\\n\\nAddendum: Though I referenced this in my review, the other great feature here is that it can be moved from guitar to guitar with little effort..just loosening the strings to reach in and removed the endpin jack.

Tried the Preludes for the first time a month ago as a set came with my daughter's new 1/2 sized violin.

This pickup is not meant to have pure chunk. This pickup is made to sound like Dimebag, and have Dimebag's sound. And it does! Anyone that argues that point, its a fact they're dead wrong. I know this for two simple reasons, 1.) I own this pickup in one of my Dean Dimebag custom guitars, and 2.) because it IS THE EXACT SAME pickup that Dimebag used! Any other problems not being able to achieve his sound, is due to their guitar that this sits in, the pedals and effects they are using, the players style and ability to achieve his sound, and the head and cab that are being used.

I mean, think about this, can you imagine dimebags warm tone on his guitar, as if he played some Fear Factory songs on it? It would sound nothing like Fear Factory. It sounds just as warm and smooth as all the albums he has put out in the past. Now if you want pure chunk, as today's heavy metal standards, then go with something else like the active 81/85 set or the destroyer or something. You simply can't take something that's meant to sound one way, and make it sound another. This pickup is exactly the same that Dime used, hence it serves the exact purpose it was made to serve. Yah can't take Zakk Wylde's custom pickups and say they suck because they don't sound like Dimebags.\\n\\nQuite simple, this pickup sounds great, and as intended.

Just used these for the first time. Perfect feel and sound bridges lighter less durable rods/brushes with standard drumsticks. I always hated how the lighter thinner rods splinter off like dry spaghetti. Lightning rods are a designed better than other rods IMO because of the rounder tips. Also, because of the thicker diameter of the individual rods, I was able to get through four sets with little indication of splinter damage so often seen with other rods. However, I did switch to standard sticks more in the 3rd and 4th sets when the volume crept up to more bar/club levels.

No brand of pickup really sounds like the other and all of them have been great, never really had a \"bad\" pickup per say. Every guitar responds differently to pickup changes for that matter too, but when it comes down to it I have used the 59\\' in my superstrat, Les Paul, PRS and back again. The tone is rather neutral, full of presence and somewhat bright (which is a trademark of many Duncan pickups). In the neck of a guitar it is capable of getting crunch, growl, bite and snarl - all depending on what you want it to do and what amp you might be using. Has just about the perfect amount of output too - not too weak like a T-Top or PAF, but not to high strung yet firm, never can overwhelm it with too much gain either it seems. Always clear sounding with warm overtones. Versatility is the name here and depending on how you set you eq, you can achieve nearly any tone you set out to get. Countless and nameless artists rely on the 59\\' in the neck position of their guitars - it\\'s almost and industry secret.\\n\\nIt\\'s like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord of pickups (but not quite as boring) - not boutique or super high-grade per say, but quality nonetheless and really the only pickup you\\'d ever want or need once you try it.

You don't even have to apply a WHOLE lot of preasure. I do still feel that it is much more safe than my taylor gig bag though.\\n\\nAll and all, I like the case. I got what I paid for. I could have got a case straight from Taylor that probably would fit my guitar perfect, but that was $200. I only paid $125 for this, and it really isn't that bad.

It certainly is no substitute for a custom-made anvil-type tour case, but then a case like that would cost four or five times more than the SKB 18.\\n\\nIf only because of SKB's awesome customer service, I can recommend this case.

That would be fairly / roughly accurate.\\n\\nThey still sound fairly similar to drum sticks as far as hitting toms and the snare, but at a reduced volume level.  Although with a good rim shot you still can get fairly loud with them... BUT if you do hit rim shots you might break one or more of the individual bundled sticks, so beware of that!\\n\\nAs far as the ride cymbal, these are WAY quieter - very much.  In fact as far as riding the ride cymbal is concerned, the volume is reduced even greater than that of the toms and snare drum.\\n\\nSo, thats roughly the idea with these.  They are meant to reduce playing volume with out having to concentrate so much on your playing.  Meaning you can still play just about as hard as you would with regular drum sticks, but the volume will be noticeably softer.\\n\\nFor the right application these work great.  Also one more thing, these don\\'t bounce as well as regular drum sticks but bouncing them off of a ride cymbal still can (reasonably) be achieved.\\n\\nSummary: they work great for reducing your playing volume with out much effort.

Another problem is that only E and G strings have this tiny plastic \"sleeve\" on them which stays between the strings and the bridge to prevent the strings from cutting into the bridge.

It was the best guitar case ever made--a gig bag with hard interior walls that protects like a hardshell case. Then, for no apparent reason, it was discontinued. SuXX0rZ.

It\\'s equal to any non-flight-rated hard case.\\n- The pockets are all useful and well thought out. The big pocket will fit a 15\" laptop and/or a pile of sheet music.

Both are solid.\\n\\nAll in all, the Contego is an excellent bag. If you\\'ve ever owned an InCase Slim Bag, you\\'ll be disappointed, as every feature of the Contego is a budget version of the Slim Bag.

Yes, it's pretty sounding, yes, the depth switch makes it so much more fun, but more over, it actually makes you stand back and think about what you want to get from it. It may be only one knob, but from that one knob comes many tones and you'll never regret having a chorus, rather, that you waited so long to get this one.\\n\\nOne tiny thing, however. Maybe this is what it is normally like, but my knob stops turning left at the second dash, and stops turning right about two dashes past the last dash. I guess the knob was put on a little to much to the right. It doesn't affect my tone. It's not like I can't have it at zero, or at full blast, it's just that my zero is at two and my full blast is plus two past the last.\\n\\nAnd lastly, I didn't have any trouble fitting it on my pedalboard. The battery door and screw do stick out, but if you put velcro on so that it lines around the edges of the battery door it becomes even and will fit on the board fine. Or, you could just put it on the board sideways so that the battery door lies in between the bars of your board.\", \"After many years away from guitar playing, I wanted a lush chorus for a new acoustic guitar with built-in preamp. At first I did have the sound guys use our one rackmount effects unit in our church to insert a chorus on the guitar channel at the mixer, but then the vocalists lost reverb and delay. I was bummed because the chorus sound throughout the system was awesome with the rack unit. I was hoping I could get a pedal to provide that same rich sound, but I didn't think a pedal would be capable of providing the rich tone of a higher-[riced rackmount unit. But I started browsing for different FX pedals and I kept seeing Electro-Harmonix products pop up, still looking the exact same as they did in the 70s, and was amazed they were still around. OK, to the point: every review I read for chorus stomp boxes kept pointing back to the EH sounding the best which I did not expect in 2015. So I bought one knowing returns are a breeze on Amazon, lol. I plugged in a Fender acoustic into this Small Clone and into a DI box and on to the mixer, and the chorus sound blew my socks off, plain and simple. The sound was HUGELY lush, I could have sat there and played all day. It was a couple hours before the service was to start and there were people milling about the sanctuary, and they stopped and commented on the rich guitar sound throughout the room, and I was just lightly strumming some major and minor 7 chords.

After many YouTube demos i decided to go with the EHX for the bass...I didn\\'t want an overpowering chorus sound for the mix, nor did i require the multiple abilities to alter the sound. I now view this as an essential pedal for my board. Its one knob and depth switch keep the sound interesting to a crowd but it doesnt take the attention off of the entire band or the beautiful music we are all creating, but when the bass solo appears the crowds are in awe of the sounds that can be produced. Its a little bigger than your average EHX stompbox and the 1/8\" power jack is confusing why EHX would continue with, but if youve purchased a powered pedal board you should get a minimum of 2 1/8\" jacks (such as the SKB line) if not the visual sound package for 9v has three for you. I would have prefered the vintage, but found the reissue simpler to get immediately. The only negative i have noticed is that although it does not take away from the dry signal I have noticed that it does drop my gain very slightly.

I really don't know if that makes any difference sound-wise since I didn't do a comparison, but I feel better knowing the stand is resting on a Gramma instead of directly on the floor.  My third and fourth Grammas were purchased to go underneath left and right studio monitors used to amplify electronic drums when I want to hear them without using headphones. Again, they do the trick of isolating the sound so what you hear comes from the speakers and not impacted by the floor. They are very sturdy and the claim that they support 300 lbs seems accurate to me.

It can reduce the reflections in your listening or recording environment, but won't reduce the energy of the sound being transferred from inside a room to outside or vice-versa.\\n\\nSound transfers from inside to outside as energy from the speakers/subwoofer resonates through walls/joists/ceiling/floors/windows to the outside. You know how when you pluck a guitar string the whole guitar resonates? That's what your sound system is doing to your home. The effects are worse if there is any way for air to reach the outside. A little space under a door can increase the sound transfer by a noticeable amount. It's similar to how a guitar is loudest near the soundhole.\\n\\nThe only way to prevent this from happening is to stop the sound from ever reaching your walls/floor/ceiling and to keep air from reaching outside. The way studios do this is by building a room completely inside another room, including pouring a new concrete floor separated from the original floor by something akin to hockey pucks. Instead of putting drywall on the studs as in normal home construction, studio builders will leave the inside wall unfinished, build completely new framing, and hang drywall on that. If sealed properly, the inside room will transfer sound to the air between the walls--but the sound won't get much farther than that.\\n\\nNote that for this to work, you also must have double doors (pretty solid, heavy ones) and airtight seals on all windows/doors so that no air escapes the inner room.\\n\\nSound elaborate? Ever wonder why studio time is so expensive? I know a friend who spent $20,000 on the build for his home studio alone. It is very effective at preventing outside noise from getting in and sound from loud instruments from getting out, but you get what you pay for.\\n\\nThis foam, by contrast, is a relatively inexpensive way to keep sound from bouncing around inside a room. Discerning music listeners or those recording instruments in their homes can improve the listening or recording environment by using foam to keep sound from bouncing around inside a home. Ever notice how a high-school gym sounds very echoey? This foam (if you had sufficient quantities) could be used to treat such a gym to make it sound more like your living room. Or it could be used to make your living room sound more like the inside of a recording studio: controlled and not overly reverberant. It won't prevent your neighbors from hearing you blasting Prince at 3 AM.\\n\\nI have no affiliation with Auralex. I don't even prefer their products for room treatment, though I have used them.

In my studio, it did exactly what I needed it to do, and I can confidently recommend it. However, you need to know what this is for, I\\'m not a sound engineer, but this is what I\\'ve gathered from a month of looking at tons of videos and reading tons of forums to learn how to sound treat my studio. Also, English is my second language but I\\'ll do my best to explain this clearly.\\n\\nThere are two different types of sound treatment, and I really mean they\\'re TOTALLY DIFFERENT: (I\\'ll explain)\\n1) Sound Proofing\\n2) Acoustic Sound Treatment\\n\\n1) Sound proofing: This is when you\\'re trying to make it so no one outside a room hears what goes on inside the room, and vice versa. This foam is NOT FOR THIS PURPOSE. This foam will NOT make your studio/room sound proof, so please don\\'t give it a bad rating if you used it for the wrong purpose.\\n\\n2) Acoustic Sound Treatment: This is what this foam is for. It will catch sound frequencies (specially high and mid frequencies, but definitely not the bass) when they try to bounce on the walls and will absorb a little, and scatter a little in order to reduce the echo or reverberation effect. This will in turn make your studio/room sound \"dead\" which gives your ears a chance to hear your mix a lot more accurately, and without the room adding it\\'s own sound effect to your creations.\\nIn laymen\\'s terms, it absorbs some of the sound because it is porous and waves that try to go through bounce so much they lose momentum and die, and the waves that don\\'t go through get broken up by the pyramid shapes and sent back weaker, and spread out.\\n\\nWith that said, there are better ways of treating a studio than this foam. I recommend you look into Fiberglass Panels made with \"Owens Corning 703\" a quick google search will yield tutorials on how to make these bad boys yourself, and they\\'re many times better than this foam, I guarantee it. I personally use this foam for the ceiling of my studio, and in my recording booth for the ceiling, and a small part of the wall lining. I use the Fiberglass panels for the walls, this combination of the two has yielded Amazing results.\\n\\nHow to Adhere: This is a very common question in forums, and every person will give you a different method. Here are 2 of experiences with them, and how I managed to get them on.\\n\\nFirst attempt -  The not so good 3M Super 77 Multipurpose Adhesive Spray method:\\nI wanted to be able to remove them when I move, so at first I tried this 3M Super 77 and sprayed it on the back of the wedges, then put it on the ceiling. That was a DISASTER. I came back the next day to find all of them all on the floor, and I had used the spray generously. To fix this, I sprayed the wedges again, and I also sprayed the area of the ceiling where the blocks are going to be, with adhesive on both ends, it works a lot better.\\nBIG FAT RED WARNING: This spray creates a mist, that could potentially fall on your equipment, and make it sticky for a good while, so if you go with this spray, cover the gear below with newspaper while you spray it on the ceiling, and spray the foam blocks into a piece of cardboard, or outside.\\n\\nThe second and better method - 3M High-Strength 90 Spray Adhesive:\\nThis spray is a lot stronger, and it shoots a kind of silly string, so it doesn\\'t create the sticky mist that other one does, thus it\\'s a lot safer to use in your studio with all your expensive gear. The only downside, is that once you stick it, it\\'s a lot harder to take off the wall, albeit not impossible. To use this spray you MUST SPRAY BOTH WALL AND FOAM, otherwise it will not stick.\\n\\nAnother Tip: This foam works better when you change the direction of the pyramids with every block, as to create this pattern:\\n|||||||||||||||\\n||||||||||||||||||\\n|||||||||||||||\\n||||||||||||||||||\\n\\nPlease let me know if there\\'s anything that should be added, or corrected here.

So here are a few questions for you know-it-all people:\\n\\n1. If the Auralex Studiofoam has a NOISE REDUCTION COEFFICIENT (NRC) rating of .80, meaning it absorbs about 80% upper-mid to high frequencies...does it mean that it does NOT reduce the sound transmission to other materials behind the foam?\\n\\n2. Then you would argue that soundproofing is the art of isolating the sound from one room to the next or from the outside world. And sound absorption does not stop the transmission or movement of sound. I would counter argue: if parts of the sound have been absorbed by the foam then the transmitted sound have been reduced. Is it safe to say that a reduced sound is a quieter acoustic transfer?\\n\\n3. If the foam can absorb some frequencies & reduces the amount of sound being transferred from the foam to whatever material behind it then isn't having some sound-absorbing abilities also the same as having some soundproofing abilities?\\n\\nI am not an acoustician but a big part of sound is subjective dependent on how each individual perceives it. Yes, there are scientific ways to interpret sound but there is no concrete evidence if there is a standard way of how individual brains interpret perceived sound. So just because these people have read definition of things on the internet doesn't mean they have keener or more sensitive ears than everybody. If a reviewer says that he thinks his room got quieter after he installed these foams then that is his perception.

While it's no secret that the springs on these need a certain amount of use to break in, the spring today is still not much better. When placed correctly, the capo generally keeps good intonation. However, I've found that it often takes several re-positions to get the right sound. The capo works good at capo 1&2, but will almost guaranteed pull the strings out of tune at capo 3 onwards. If the capo is pulling the strings so much as to majorly de-tune them (more than a half-step over time) imagine what it is doing to the frets for wear? The Kyser may be the quickest and easiest capo to change, but the bottom line is that it's tension is alarmingly tight and has the potential to damage the neck over time. If you're working off a cheaper guitar that you don't care too much about, the Kyser is no doubt the easiest and most convenient capo choice. I would by no means recommend this capo if you are using an expensive guitar due to it's tendency to over-exert pressure.

However, it is probably the least comfortable harmonica I have played.  I've tried adjusting it, but that doesn't really fix the problem.  I have pretty much decided on using the Seydel Session harmonicas - they are easier to bend and the most comfortable harmonicas I have played.  Seedy Session harmonicas have a kind of muted sound, which is nice and bluesy.  The Hohner Crossover is kind of brassy and the best sounding harmonica for my taste.  The Blues Harp is kind of in the middle.  The Manji also has a nice sound, a lot like the Hohner Crossover, but It is a little temperamental; some of the reeds freeze up and don't blow.  The Crossover is a great harp and can do anything that you want it to - if you are really good and if you can adjust the reeds - but it isn't as easy to play as the Seydel Sessions.  If you can master it, the Crossover is a great sounding harmonica, but if you need a little help, the Seydel Sessions is simply the easiest to play harmonica I have found.  To sum up, the Seydel sounds great and is the easiest and most comfortable harmonica I have played.  The Blues Harp is not comfortable to play, but it does sound great.  It may not be as responsive as some harmonicas, but hey, I'm not Jason Ricci; this harp is better than me.  If you just want to jam some blues, this is harp will work.  It is built solid, it sounds great and is a blast to play.  The Manji is a great sounding harp, but kind of temperamental and needs some adjustment.

I am liking it better ... and I will explain at the end +++\\n\\nI started with a cheap Hohner Blues Band, and have (in about 6 months) tried several excellent Hohner harmonicas. They include the Golden Melody (C), Special 20 (G), and Chromonica 270 (C). I recently bought the Hohner Blues Harp in G and thought I would share a few comparative notes.\\n\\nSome things I like about the Blues Harp over the other 3 are:\\n- The case - it allows the harmonica to breath (vital for the wood comb) and holds it firmly in place (I won't hear the harmonica tapping the sides of the case if I walk around with it inside my pants pocket as I do with the Golden Melody and Special 20)\\n- The hardware - the screws are solidly built (machined) for ease of dissassembly/reassembly\\n- The reed plates - these are thicker than on any other harmonica I've owned - they only need 2 screws plus the 2 cover plate screws to keep these in place (compared with 5 or more screws commonly seen on lighter weight plates). That shows how solid/thick these plates are.\\n- The wood comb - makes it seem a little more of a traditional instrument (don't get me wrong - I love plastic for its durability)\\n- The reeds - these things are QUALITY - Hohner has their machining process down to a science on these things and they are beautiful works of art compared to the other harmonicas I've taken apart\\n\\nWhat's not to like? Well - some people have complained about how the reed plates jut out a little from the front of the comb - about how some models have actually been sharp (rough edge on lips). I've learned how to adjust my lips so that I can get a tighter seal because if I don't, I tend to get a little more harmony than melody going. The edges have been comfortable to play on. But it does require an ever so slightly different lip seal than I learned playing on the Golden Melody and Special 20 (both which have significantly cover styles from each other).\\n\\n***\\nAfter spending a few hours playing the Blues Harp in G and trying to learn an Irish Jig, and then returning to my Special 20 (also in G), I quickly discover that on the Special 20 (with its plastic comb), it requires far less effort to maintain a seal with my lips and I get a much more solid single note sound for my efforts. I blame this on the wood comb on the Blues Harp not extending out to the front edge of the reed plates. I assume this problem exists because Hohner expects the comb to swell with time and use.\\n***\\n\\nWho is this harmonica best for? Maybe not the beginner (consider one of the other 2 models like the Golden Melody or Special 20 which both have a plastic comb). When you get this harmonica, you will want to baby it. Slowly break it in playing softly for a week or two. Keep it in its case at all times to keep the scratches off the covers. Never try to rinse out the comb. Knock out any moisture after every playing session. This is good for the intermediate/advanced player who has learned to appreciate their instrument and takes the effort to do things like rinse/brush their teeth before playing.\\n\\nHohner considers this model to be part of their professional series. With that in mind, they sell replacement reed plates (think of it like a very expensive new set of strings for a guitar).\\n\\n***\\nI now assume it's for professionals because they will have developed their playing technique to the point that they are more able to hit the notes regardless of the wooden comb's gap from the front of the reed plate.\\n***\\n\\nIs there a big difference in sound between this and the others? I'm not qualified to answer that question. Well - actually I can say that every one of these Hohner's made in Germany harmonicas blow the made in China Blues Band out of the water in terms of quality and playability out of the package (I have since learned how to tweak and retune the cheap Chinese Blues Bands to make them playable, but they are significantly inferior - you truly get what you pay for). Since I have tinkered with the reeds on most of my harps (gapping on most of them for consistent playability), I feel that my experience looking inside of the few harps I have owned qualifies me to say that the Blues Harp is a high quality instrument and I am proud to own one.\\n\\n***\\nDo I now wish I still bought the Blues Harp - I'm not sure. I will keep it just because it is beautiful plus it is too late to return it. Perhaps if I really preferred the MS series of harps with their exchangeable components, I should have tried one with a plastic comb instead. I bought it on a whim thinking it would be cool, and it was purchased from a local retailer that was not a national chain nor had a wide selection. I'm glad I supported the retailer, but I will think twice before I purchase another harmonica with a wood comb (besides the Chromonica which had a nice metal mouth piece over a wood comb - not an issue there). And - who knows - perhaps the more I play with the Blues Harp, the better my technique will improve. I think my skills are still in the beginner/intermediate range.\\n***\\n\\n+++\\nI have since discovered that the small gap between the front face of the comb and the reed plates on the low end of the harp (holes 1-4) was easily fixed by loosening the two screws holding the reed plates together and pushing the comb forward between the two plates. It is now properly flush and plays better.\\n\\nI like this  harp - it has its place for blues (as opposed to the Golden Melody which plays folk music better).

I love the oriental style, the shiny gold trim, the colors (I chose the navy blue) and the quality.  I am currently using it on a Sea Gull electric acoustic and the blue strap on the brown guitar really looks great.  It was a bit difficult getting the strap on the button on the bottom of the guitar because the strap's end is thick, but I'd honestly rather struggle a bit in putting it on and have a thick end that will be durable, instead of easily putting on a thin strap that will either easily come off or rip.  At the top end, I'm using the Planet Waves quick release strap (in place of the shoe string option since my guitar doesn't have a button at the top and I don't feel comfortable having one drilled in), which is a fantastic combination.  In fact, so much so that I have the same Planet Waves/Levi's strap combination on another acoustic guitar, which is why I chose to do the same on a second guitar.\", \"The design and colors on this guitar strap are incredible.

Not a horrible thing if you want the guitar to stay in place, but if you want some play in your guitar position this isn't the best thing. Wearing synthetic clothing on stage and you could catch and pull that fabric. It's a shame the back side of this strap wasn't designed as well as the front side.\\n\\nAmazing color and design hampered by plastic-like thread on a synthetic back side.

I have to say that I would not fault anyone for using these Marquis strings.  It\\'s a matter of preference.  I like the SP\\'s for: volume (they project pretty well), the awesome tone.  I would say the Marquis are more \"subdued\" or \"refined\" sounding, compared to the SP\\'s. They have a nice sound but it seems like it\\'s an attenuated or equalizer-flat version of the SP strings so everything I like in the Marquis is way better in the SP\\'s.  In a sense, the Marquis are quite possibly more \"accurate\" sounding, compared to the SP\\'s which are comparatively amped up.  All being equal, I can\\'t imagine why anyone would choose a quieter string over a louder or better projecting one, but it may suit some people\\'s taste or guitar.  I hope this helps people make an informed decision tailored to what they are looking for.  As for me, I will be using the SP Martins from now on.

Here are my thoughts on a number of Levy\\'s straps.\\n\\nFirst off, I think it\\'s worth it to spend some money on your guitar strap. If you want to feel spoiled when you put your guitar on, get a nice looking strap.\\n\\nAn important secondary benefit is the comfort. Even my heavy Epiphone Les Paul (almost 10 pounds) feels good with a nice, wide padded strap.\\n\\nLevy\\'s straps are among the best on both accounts. I have four Levy\\'s straps and feel I\\'ve had varying levels of success in getting what I wanted.

It has an embossed Levy\\'s logo on it. This was the least expensive strap that I bought, and it does the job, but is not so inspiring putting it on. In all honesty, I wish I would have spent a little more to get a nicer looking strap. Odds are that I will have this strap for decades and for another $5-$30 I could have gotten something really spectacular.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Levy-s-Leathers-MSS1-BLK-Veg-Tan-Leather-Guitar-Strap-Black/dp/B000XPSL8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Levy\\'s Leathers MSS1-BLK Veg Tan Leather Guitar Strap,Black</a>&nbsp;This strap is similar to PM32 but has a brown logo on it.

Rather than being a brown, it is actually a burgundy. It did not go with the guitar at all. I was going to send it back, and then I realized it matched my Stratocaster with the tortoise pickguard. In fact, it matches it really well so I kept it and I\\'m extremely happy with it. The two tone, black and burgundy, strap really looks classy. I think the two tone is the way to go.

It was the nicest that they had and it was my first Levy\\'s strap. It is also the least expensive of the bunch at under $40. And I consider one of the nicest straps that I own. The things that I like about it are that it is very soft and flexible. The leather straps are stiffer and not as supple. Another great thing about it is the brown suede with the black bead along the edge that gives it a two tone effect. I really like the look. That\\'s why I put it on my most expensive guitar, even thought is was the least expensive strap. The only downside was that it left some suede particles on my shirt the first few times that I used it. However, that stopped after a few uses.\\n\\nAny of the last three straps listed above are a joy to own.

I am aware this thing must be \"broken into\" to have its true feel.', \"I recently acquired a '02 P-bass and decided to treat myself to some new accessories, including a strap. I sauntered over to Guitar Center on 14th Street. While it had a wide selection, nothing really caught my eye other than the rather pricey numbers. I came home and hit up Amazon to see what it had. This strap seemed perfect - wide but not too wide. I read the reviews and was concerned about the stiffness of the leather where the strap attached to the bass but after it arrived I experienced zero issues with that. I played a 3 hour gig a week later and was happy with the feel and how my shoulder and back felt after it was over. Looks good and a great price.\", \"I just recently tried these picks and love them so much I ordered another set.

An absolutely outstanding way to treat customers I would only hope that some other companies start to treat people the same way.\\n\\nThe Kyser Capo itself is a great Capo with just one major flaw which depending on how you look at it can be a major flaw or a minor flaw. The problem is the adjustability of the tension. There are YouTube videos out there from Kyser themselves explaining how you can actually been this into adjustability that you can work with. The problem is it doesn't exactly work is easily as they say it does. They are absolutely wonderful to deal with and they actually replaced an older capo for me free of charge. They claim that the older materials were not conducive to flexibility so they took it upon themselves to offer me a newer model. I appreciated that so much by that company that I ordered this one on Amazon just to show my support. Unfortunately it is still extremely difficult to pin this item to the desire tension that you needed for various guitar. Again I feel it is in either minor or major flaw depending on how many times you use it how many different guitars you use with it and so on. Myself, find this to be a minor flaw which is why I feel it gets an outstanding four star review. Of course with this one drawback it prevents me from giving it that final V Star which I allocate for absolutely perfect products that work flawlessly for me.\\n\\nKyser is an absolutely wonderful company to work with and they were very accommodating and I appreciate that and I will continue to support them and use their Capo happily, butt I just feel that it comes ever so sure of that 5-star because of that one option.\\n\\nNow as far as the rest of the Capo goes it is of course very easy to take on and off, attached to the end of the headstock if you wish, to get enough tension on just about any acoustic 6 string guitar that you're using it on. I don't believe that weight is really that significant for CatOS in this day in age, but to be thorough it is obviously a very light unobtrusive object to keep on the neck. It doesn't make the neck heavier and does not seem to alter the way the guitar feels feels in any way shape or form. It opens and closes snugly but you should be able to get used to that rather quickly. It is made like a truck so I don't believe you will have any problems in a year or 30 years. And I believe that the parts are replaceable where there is were possible.

Nice\", 'I had to write this review because of my recent significant experience with Dunlop Jazz III picks, not to be confused with Jazz III \"XL\" picks, which are larger. I started playing 3 and 1/2 years ago and only took 5 or 6 lessons, mainly to ensure I had the basic form right.  I used different picks, primarily Gibson and Fender Mediums, primarily because the guy at the guitar store recommended them, and did not really know what I needed.\\n\\nAs time went on, I tried the Dunlop Jazz III XLs and stuck with them for three years. It worked great for Jazz, Blues, Rock, and Metal.  Also, the wide base worked well with aggressive strumming, and the stiffness allowed for aggressive single-note lines. You could really move those strings around with authority and accuracy.  Yet I soon realized that I was in a rut, and could not increase my speed during my practice of scales and fast riffs.\\n\\nA couple of years ago, a guy had recommended the smaller, original Jazz IIIs, but I tried them and did not like them.  Around three months ago, I picked one up from the original package that had been sitting around, and I soon found my speed increasing.  This was especially true during string-skipping maneuvers.  I believe the wideness of the Jazz III XLs made them a little ungainly for me at higher speeds when maneuvering between strings and having to take awkward picking angles.  The smaller size of the Jazz IIIs helped minimize these impediments.  I use both the original nylon AND the Stiffo versions, although I favor the Stiffo because I don\\'t want my picks deforming too much at speed.  The Jazz III XLs do have the advantage when strumming rhythm passages.  The wider base gives you more to hold on to and more leverage with the up and down strokes.  But, as my fingers adjust and grow stronger, I am finding I can strum almost as well with the smaller Jazz IIIs.\\n\\nFinally, I like the slightly duller sound of the Dunlop Jazz IIIs, although I have discovered that when playing with distortion, it may be necessary to increase my attack to get that breakup and edge that I am looking for.  Since I switched, I have to say the difference in my technical ability, and my tone, has been dramatic!', 'holds picks well and stays on the stand.', 'I bought this for our guitar player (since she had the tendency to lose her picks.

It really has everything you would need for a basic setup (and then some).  Sure, you won\\'t have a full complement of \"wonky\" effect (though there are some fun synth options), but it has more than enough options to set you on top.  Things I love about the pedal:\\n1.  Aesthetically, it\\'s pleasing and has a very cool professional appearance.  I know that aesthetics aren\\'t always a huge concern for people...but I know that some, like me, do have a little affinity for it haha.\\n\\n2.  The build is strong.  It\\'s not some cheap plastic, but totally metal.  The only plastic pieces are knobs, switches, and the wah/effect pedal...but even those are made of thick and durable plastic.\\n\\n3.  Wonderful organization for a wide variety of effect combinations and in-show adjustments:\\n  A - There\\'s an independent compressor/limiter (that is quite effective) which you can easily turn on and off let alone adjust.\\n  B - A separate \"master\" Equalizer for easy equalizing needs (has nobs for Low, Mid, Mid Frequency adjustment, High, and Volume.\\n  C - Has 3 independent Effect switches and each switch can manage two different effects.  And each switch has a main knob to choose\\n  effects as well as respective adjustment knobs.  This means that during a show, I can do things like quickly (and spontaneously)\\n  switch off my distortion, but keep the other effects, if the band suddenly decides to play in more of a ballad style.\\n  D.  The wah/effect pedal is easily switched on and off...and has it\\'s own effects attached to it.  It can serve as a wah, a sound hold, a\\n  resonance pedal, or an octave slide (up or down)...or even a kick drum metronom where you literally tap the tempo to set the speed\\nand volume of the kick.\\n4.  It has several factory presets, but you can also easily create your own and save them easily.\\n\\n5.  Clear visual reminders of how to access major features (such as the memory mode).\\n\\n6.  It has a tuner...who doesn\\'t love turners? haha\\n\\n7.  You can also plug in earphones...or direct to the system if you don\\'t want to go through an amp (you can even do it stereo).\\n\\n8.  It can run on batteries if you don\\'t have a  power supply/adapter.\\n\\nReally, this is a wonderful all around setup that will get you far on its own.  It has very few weaknesses.  One time, I even mimic\\'ed an electric guitar for a song with it using the octave up features and distortion (this was the days before I had an actual electric guitar).  The only real weak point for me was the synth feature...it\\'s not as strong in the lower registers of the bass as it is in the higher for the set-up I\\'ve had to do.', 'This was a gift for my bass player from his dad. I was merely the purchaser to get it here by Christmas. This thing is awesome. We spent some real time with it in the studio the last few sessions and I have to say the effects sound great and the simplicity is nice. My bass player has never used pedals before and given that this has simple stomp box functionality and multi-effect flexibility, it is a good fit for a novice pedal user. I could also see value in it for a professional wanting a simple set up to take to gigs with them.', \"A personal note first: Thats was the last multi effects I purchased before I realized I was done with those and bought only specific pedals. Don't get me wrong, as far as bass multi-effects goes the ME-50B might be the best product out there. Easy to use, overall very useable sounds (nice synth), not so expensive, sturdy as hell.\\n\\nThe thing is, even though I could get 1000 tones out of it, I never managed to get my tone. Which is something I found later when I took a more simple approach. If you are at the same point and you are hesitating. Go to your guitar shop and try out many pedals. Maybe you will find the 2 or 3 pedals that really suit you.\\n\\nAnyway all of this is personal and this is not the reason I took one star off. The expression pedal was a great disapointment... I had high expectations on this one and as always with multieffects it sounded very cheap and very annoying.\", \"I never wanted to plug into a bunch of crap like a guitar player w/ a bunch of boxes on the floor but my buddy @ the pawn shop said 'dude just try it out and bring it back if you don't like it.' Well I was totally blown away and had to go back and pay for it (@ the goodbuddy discount). HAD TO!!! Theres really way more options/effects than I actually use or have space to list here, but everyone will find something they like, and the effects sound great, they're fairly easy to access, program and edit. Basically you pick a pedal and choose an effect, tweek it, then you can save it to ANY of the 3 pedals then when you need it, just step on it. You have 8 banks of 3 pedals each, press a button to go to the next bank of 3 pedals. 8x3=24 effects pedals with saved settings but find I really only use bank #1 of 3 pedal/effects. Heres my preferred use in order of importance; tuner/volume pedal, pedal#1=clean which about 20% of the time I will rock the volume pedal all the way forward untill it 'clicks' and boom,-instant wah wah. Works great to boost mids just to cut thru without rocking it back and forth(WAH WAH sound, but then that is fun too). pedal#2 chorus, pedal#3 wah with delay and use the guitar volume pot to mimic keyboard swells which works great to fill out space in a 3 piece band. Thats really all I use but the no-hands-required tuner/volume pedal alone is worth its weight in gold. Good tip; put it in your effects loop for a good clean sound and excellent dynamics. I found it doesnt like the front of the amp, maybe just me or the gain of a great Ampeg SVT3 is too much but it clips if you plug into it and then into your amp. Take your time, try EVERYTHING and you won't be disapointed. ROcK IT!!!!\", \"Great picks.  They have a rough grip that makes them easy to keep hold of with sweaty hands.  I have played with them for over 30 years, and have never broke one.  They don't wear out.  The only reason I bought these was to replace ones that I have lost or given away.\", 'I recommend it.', 'Been using Dunlop nylon picks since about 1982.

So there\\'s nothing \"wrong\" with these picks - but I don\\'t get much of a \"pick sound\" when I strum with them, and they\\'re so soft, they don\\'t work well for me to pick  strings individually - and have a softness in the resultant sound that comes closer to finger-plucking a string than any other pick I\\'ve tried.', 'These pedals are great!! A friend of mine said I should buy other pedals because these pedals aren\\'t manufactured by a very known brand name but I went with my own judgement and I was not disappointed with them. I have increased my speed a lot since I\\'ve gotten em and I can pedal songs like \"All Nightmare Long\" and \"Beast and the Harlot\" now  =]  great pedals. BUT, it takes time to develop speed so don\\'t think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can\\'t go all Jason Costa on em', \"When I purchased this pedal from a local music store I wasn't even looking for a double pedal set, but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my Tama Stagestar kit.  During my quest for a pedal that had the feel I wanted I sat behind a Pacific drum kit that had these pedals. At first I ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hi-hat.  I liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when I decided to see what it was like playing double. Wow - it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities.\\n\\nThis pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable, especially cam rotation, spring tension, and beater offset.  Most of the adjustments require a hex wrench, which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals. The left side slave pedal has a full floorplate, and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle I have tried.  There is a slight lag on the left pedal, which is normal for any double pedal configuration, but you'll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal.\\n\\nBefore I purchased this particular model I tried out Tama's Iron Cobra, Pearl's Powershifter and a Gilbralter Avenger.  I did not like the stiffness of the Iron Cobra, but did like the Pearl and Gibraltar pedals.  It finally came down to either this or the Gibralter, which was slightly smoother, but significantly more expensive.  I opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedal.\\n\\nIf you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration I strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look.  More importantly, try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models - selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price, features and quality.  It has to feel right.  In addition, you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi-hat, which means that you will need to compensate.  For that I recommend the Gibraltar hi-hat drop clutch (ASIN B0002F73YY), which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi-hat with ease.  I have my hi-hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position, but stepping on the hi-hat pedal - using the clutch - puts it in full play position.  Tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again.  This clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal!\", \"I bought these picks after reading that many pro players use them.

These picks are by no means for everyone, as they provide a level of thickness that really goes beyond any worry of the pick flexing.

Comfortable to hold and feels solid.  Has a beveled edge which makes it great for fast attack.\\n2.  Easier picking--clear and articulate tone on steel strings. Gives good attenuation in low end- very punchy.  Might be good on heavier strings or bass guitars.\\n3.  Reasonably priced\\n\\nMy criticisms:\\n1.  The hard plastic does not give at all.  Strumming seems to produce more of a \"picking\" sound rather than a smooth tone on steel strings.  If you normally hold your picks firm, you will need to lighten your grip some to get a smooth strum.\\n2.  I normally use nylon picks and I\\'m not sure if nylon is porous, but with the hard plastic on these stubbies, I could feel the oils from my fingers build up on the pick.  Not a big issue but something I\\'ve never noticed with regular nylon picks.\\n3.  Pinch harmonics require you to hold the pick closer to the tip and I found that this becomes a little more challenging with the stubby tips.\\n\\nI purchased these to experiment on my tone.  My guitars either have 9s or 11s strings, and these felt good on the 11s.  Not so much on the lighter strings.  Bottom line, plectrums are a personal choice and after using these for several hours, I always found myself returning to my old picks.  I may give their nylon version a try.', \"Easy to grip, the thickness and tapered edge give you a lot of control, and they are pretty.

However, I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues.

Sure, they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems. By far the biggest change was the \"pointy-ness\" of the picks.

It\\'s especially bad when playing clean electric (picking notes or strumming).\\n\\nIf someone was to ask me if these are good picks, my answer would be \"it depends.\" It really does, in my opinion, it depends on what you\\'re playing. From a rhythm standpoint, I don\\'t like these at all - they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me. For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come through.\\n\\nCould I play faster with them? No. Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldn\\'t do with my normal picks? No.\\n\\nI tried them, but didn\\'t like them.

I think they\\'re intended more for fingerstyle players than those using a pick since the strings get a little weird when played hard, but a pick would be okay with some styles of music, especially if you use a thin one -- you won\\'t hurt the strings if you use a pick, but it may not respond the way you want.\\n\\nI don\\'t notice a large difference in tone between these strings and Martin\\'s phosphor-bronze strings. In fact, I might not be able to tell the difference in a blind listening test. That means there isn\\'t a huge disadvantage in sound in using these strings. Other than that I won\\'t comment a lot on sound -- string tone is something that depends a lot on the guitar itself and your personal preference, and it\\'s best to try out a set rather than ask someone with a different instrument and different ears whether they sound \"bright\" or \"warm\" or whatnot.\\n\\nThere are a couple big differences from conventional strings, though. One is that they play quieter. Another is that they don\\'t like to be played very hard -- if you do so, the bass strings sort of flap around as they vibrate and you\\'ll get a lot of buzzing against the frets.\\n\\nAnother thing I\\'ve noticed is the strings feel extremely light to play and are very flexible. That makes them easy to bend, but maybe too easy -- they\\'re sensitive to having notes go sharp if you press too hard when fretting a note, and if you\\'re fingering a difficult chord, they\\'ll be more inclined to stretch if your finger is pressing at an angle, bending notes out of tune.

They have just enough give to play some fast strumming chords, and just enough stiffness to play lead, get good pick squalls, etc....As with all Nylon picks, you'll get a good thirty or forty hours of playtime before the tips start to dull or wear down.

The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However, they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So, i don't see how you can go wrong.\", \"Ever since I started playing the guitar, I've used the nylon Dunlop picks. They're better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick.

You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.\\n\\nAlso of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them, as you can get them at your local music store for about that.\", \"I've been using these since I started playing 12 years ago.  I often venture out and try other brands, styles, thicknesses, but I always end up coming back to the light-gray Jim Dunlop .73mm standard.\\n\\nIn my earliest days, I liked them because they didn't break like the Fender brand and whatever-else-I-was-using did.  Granted, it was poor playing technique causing the problem, but the standard nylon Dunlops held up, where as others did not.  Also, the .73mm has been the perfect thickness for me, too.  It gives enough for easy rhythm, but I'm able to play lead easily with it.  I like the .80mm just as much, and use it when I'm playing an acoustic or a more lead-focused set, but the .73mm is my personal classic and therefore my default.\\n\\nEach player has to determine what works best for them when deciding on a plectrum, so this is my input on these.  They're my default and are the standard to which any others I try are compared.

Obviously, the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar, but that isn\\'t always possible.  With that said, for what they are worth, here are my thoughts regarding Jim Dunlop\\'s purple colored, Big Stubby 3.0mm picks.\\n\\nI like a pick with a sharp point for better control, and the Big stubby certainly meets that criteria.  The sharp point and the pick\\'s rounded edges, help the Stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings, which makes for easier picking.  Besides electric guitar, I find these picks nicely suited for acoustic, and semi-solid body guitars, where the string tension is greater.\\n\\nI had tried the 1.0mm Stubby previously, but the 3.0mm pick is much thicker, and heavier, and has absolutely no \"give\" at all.  I\\'m still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard.  Although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers, when picking rapidly, I find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky.  Keeping the pick clean and dry, does help.\\n\\nMy favorite pick had been the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dunlop-0-6mm-nylon-pick/dp/B0002D0CGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dunlop 0.6mm nylon pick</a>, but I am very pleased with the performance and feel of the 3.0mm Stubby.  I can locate the strings easily, and be more precise, while still being able to play with decent speed.  Time will tell, but this may become my new favorite pick.\\n\\nThe \"pick pack\" contains 24 picks.  I only paid $2.99, which is simply an outstanding deal.  If you\\'re a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick, you might want to give this ultra heavy duty Stubby a try.', \"Good sturdy mic case.

Much better sound that the strings that come with it.', \"About 40 years ago I bought a Westwood acoustic guitar for about $100 (between $450-$500 in today's money).  The 1st time I changed the strings, I chose Martin Silk and Steel.  I was very impressed with the sound and play-ability - even as a teenager.  When I played with people, I explained what the strings were and almost always stated that the 'make my guitar sound like a Martin'.  And I did know what a Martin sounded like.  I actually got to play one at age 15.\\n\\nI have to tell you that in those 40 years, I have used NO OTHER strings on the guitar other than the Martin Silk and Steel.  There was a period when I left the guitar alone and it got to a point where I could not tune it at all.  I had another new guitar and put the same strings on it.  Same great experience.  Different sound, of course.  I understood that because the newer guitar was made with different woods.  And it wasn't 40 years old (guitars are like a fine wine ... better as they age).\\n\\nMost of the reviews I see (negative) speak to buzzing or string breakage, etc.  Firstly, the G string on ANY acoustic is the most likely to fail, statistically.  Not that I have had many of those break - I just haven't.  Guitars DO change with age - and are also affected GREATLY by environmental changes.  Wooden instruments need a good consistent 40-45% relative humidity, either where that sit, or in their cases.  Maintain that, or you will most likely go out of tune and do damage to the guitar, over time.\\n\\nIf you do not have an electronic tuner, and tune your guitar with a pitch-pipe ALWAYS tune from the A string. As you adjust your tuning (hopefully you have stretched your strings when installing), tune from the LOOSE to the TIGHTER.  It will make sense when you do it.  Any problem, by the way, with how much 'harder' you need to press a string behind a fret, has NOTHING to do with the string - but EVERYTHING to do with the way the guitar is set-up.  The string heights should be as specified.  And, over time, there may be a need to have the neck reset or adjusted (via truss rod).  Leave that to a professional, if you're not sure.\\n\\nWhen changing strings, you should not have to worry about leaving extra 'winds'.  Go to the Martin site --- great video on proper string changing.  You will learn a technique that actually LOCKS the string onto the tuning peg so that the strings won't 'slip' out of tune.\\n\\nFinally, I have my Westwood in service, after attending to some of the above concerns, regarding environment and 'action' adjustment.

I\\'ve listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars.  Round and flat wound strings.  My general take is that these picks give a better, fuller, rounder bigger tone overall.  Compared to the tortex style pick material (1 mm for the tortex).  It\\'s a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material, thickness or a combination of both.  Also note, I play with the rounded edge, not the tip.  So the grip in the center of these doesn\\'t quite fit my grip style but it\\'s still ok.  I do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all.  I\\'ve been subjective in my comparisons -- but this is what I\\'ve found so far.

After listening to samples on the Seymour Duncan website and reading the various descriptions, I chose the SH-2 Jazz.  I couldn\\'t be happier with my choice.  As described, the Jazz has a \"moderate output\" and an \"articulate and clear tone\".  Chords have definition and clarity I was definitely lacking with my previous pickup, even before it went south on me.  In my opinion, the Jazz is a great pickup because it really lets the character of my guitar shine through.  I wish I had changed pickups years ago, as I feel like this guitar is finally living up to its potential.  It has always sounded so warm and resonant when played acoustic and with the Jazz in place, I\\'m finally getting that same vibe amplified.  Well done Seymour Duncan!', \"I did some research before buying 2 new humbuckers for my Ibanez S470 and came to the conclusion that the dynamic duo of Seymour Duncan's SH-2 and SH-4 were for me. I found the 2 sold together as a combo pack for a great deal at $110, when otherwise they're $70-$75 each. So I was happy I got what I wanted for much less than I was prepared to pay but enough about that.\\n\\nI gathered from the Seymour Duncan website that these 2 pickups are his favorite combination as they allow for the widest range and diversity for sound and playing style. The site also lets you see which famous musicians are using their pickups as well and it turned out that most of the rockers and metalheads listed had these 2 in their arsenal. That helped since I play mostly hard rock and metal.\\n\\nThe day I had them installed I actually found myself playing with the SH-2 for the majority of the time because it just sounded so good. Everything was crystal clear and bright. It provides a very warm and full sound that actually sounds like your using a different guitar altogether. Chords and picking sound distinguished at all volumes. It's leaps and bounds beyond the stock neck pickup which sounded too dull and weak to keep my attention. It really gave me a renewed interest in alternate playing styles with clean sounds. I understand now why S.D. likes this combination so much as the SH-2 and SH-4 can work really well together when blended with the channel switch.\\n\\nThis a really nice sounding pickup that'll be a big improvement over a stock one or an upgrade for those looking for a great clean sound.

He kept breaking the lighter picks he had and wanted to try something that was a little more heavy duty.  They seem to work well for him.  He goes back and forth between these and some lighter picks, but he does use them frequently.', \"These 1.0mm Dunlop Big Stubby picks are a transparent candyapple red color - nice! They are a tiny bit shorter and fatter than Dunlop Tortex standard teardrop picks. And they're made of polycarbonate plastic and polished glassy-smooth. This makes them glide across the strings quickly and smoothly with almost no resistance. I prefer to have a bit of friction like Tortex does.\\n\\nThe round circular thumb indentations help with grip but they would provide better grip if they were polished like the rest of the pick, rather than textured. But still, this pick has a comfortable 3-dimensional shape. The edge profile is beveled a bit like a knife edge - this reduces the tendency of a thicker pick like this to 'dig in' to the strings during up-strokes.\\n\\n1.0mm is the thinnest gauge that these come in and it's more flexible than other 1.0mm picks I've tried. For me it's the perfect balance of stiffness (control) vs. flexibility for all-round useage (both strumming and single-note picking). But if you do mostly single-note picking, you can get Big Stubbys in much thicker gauges with no flex whatsoever if that's what you prefer.\", \"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.\\n\\nYou will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy, sharp almost. After playing a bit, the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually, it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice, you won't care.\", 'First, I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.  I have dozens of them, they never wear out.  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band, and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable, and easy to control.\\n\\nNow the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself, but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable \"plinking\" sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you\\'re playing is loud music, this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics, because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.\\n\\nSo, too bad.

A great way to keep all the audio part of my rig together and to keep those 'occasionally need' bits around as well.

The inside height of the case metal edge to metal edge is 7 3/4\", slightly more plastic to plastic.\\nI agree with others about how flimsy the foam at the bottom of the case is.  It feels like something you would use for an air filter -- not for protecting a microphone from shock.\\nWhen mine arrived, the strap that limits the lid motion had a half twist in it.  It was impossible to train it to fall into the case as the lid was closed.  Fortunately it is secured with hot-melt glue, so it was easy to pull it loose, roll the glue off the inside of the case, take out the half twist and re-glue the strap to the case.\\nIn my opinion, the latches are nicely designed.  The latch-plate is circular and surrounded by a circular ridge of the case except for the opening where your finger can slide in to open the latch.  That gives reasonable protection from accidental opening, and you can tell by feel if the case is top-side-up by whether the opening is at the bottom.  The latch has an over-center spring in the pivot side that provides a force tending to keep the latch closed.\\nIn summary, the case has some flaws and some nice features.  It is a whole lot nicer than the cardboard box I was using before.', \"This is a perfect case if you have six SM58 mics or ones of a similar shape.\\nIf you put the foam windscreens on your mics, they will still fit in this case, and the windscreens offer a little extra protection on the bottom where it is a tad thin, but the mics lay in there held up by the ball end, and only a tiny bit of the base touches the bottom. It is a little tight with all six in place with windscreens on, but they are secure, and the top closes easily enough, and the latches and the handle and the exterior all seem built to last. The Gator logo lets you know which side is up, if you had any doubts.\\nIf you have some other configuration of microphones, or a different number than six, this may need some adaptation, but we use four regularly, and have two for backups or to add one if necessary. Before we were using one of the Vault cases, with some other stuff in there to take up the extra space, but this is far superior.

Recently changed to 0.007 and 0.008 string sets and first worried that a 2mm thick Lexan blade and teeny strings would be a recipe for buying new strings.  Instead, the light grip these pics facilitate coupled with the light touch needed to fret ultra-thin strings without changing the intended notes combined for all sorts of fun and enjoyment.

Since these picks don't show what their thickness is I guessed and went with the mediums.  Well, they're definitely thinner than the .73mm Dunlop Tortex picks, which I've mostly been using.  I recently went back to this gel pick and found that rhythm sounds much better with these, and the grip is slightly better as well.  I didn't realize how much the material and thickness of a pick impacted my tone, especially on electric guitar.\\n\\nAs far as the colors are concerned, I don't understand what all the fuss is over receiving a single color versus a variety.

A written review can't compare to actually playing, so take this for what it is worth.\\n\\nFor playing electric I like a pick that is flexible with some give.  Dunlop's 0.6mm nylon picks are what I prefer.  Looking for something new, I decided to try the 0.1m Big Stubby, the thinnest one available.  The Big Stubby has a pretty good feel, the depressed area for the fingers does help to maintain grip, and beveled edge helps reduce drag on the strings.  Although the Big Stubby is a very good pick, I still like the feel of the Dunlop nylons better.  The stiffness of the Stubby makes playing a little less comfortable.\\n\\nThe design is cool looking, and I can see why it would feel great to many players.  The Stubby would probably be my choice for playing acoustic or classical guitar.  They are available in various thicknesses, so you might give them a try if you prefer a stiff pick.\", 'Been using these for about 10 years - electric and acoustic.

Best part, the tone is great, really rings out.', \"The thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one (no pun intended) you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice.  I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it.  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face.  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard.  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing.  For me though, I'll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it's not my default or preferred choice for play.\", 'My favorite capo is the Kyser', 'Good product.

By that time, the grunge, detuned, and seven-string culture BOSS was trying to cater to was already starting to die out, and experienced players had well-set impression of what a BOSS distortion sounded like - largely from the venerable, yet flawed DS-1 Distortion.\\n\\nBut a funny thing happened when I plugged in the MD-2 Mega Distortion: it actually kinda rocks!  While the tone of this pedal probably isn\\'t a complete reinvention of the DS-1, the \"bottom\" control gives it considerably more bass.  In fact, this might be the only BOSS distortion pedal that gives you the low end control of a MT-2 Metal Zone without getting stuck into the niche tone of a \"metal\" pedal.  While pedals like the MI Audio Crunch Box, Marshall Guv\\'nor, and others are referred to as \"Marshall-in-a-box\" pedals, the MD-2 actually does a brilliant job on smaller combo amps of simulating the \"whomp\" of a large cabinet pushing air with bass notes.\\n\\nAlso, there\\'s a very cool interplay going on between the \"Distortion\" knob and the \"Gain Boost\" knob.  Turning up only the Gain Boost actually creates a more vintage/overdriven sound.  It\\'s punchy, but not super saturated.  The Distortion knob seems to dial in the more saturated heavy gain settings targeting nu metal and other modern players.  But neither of those options sound \"metal\" - this is a rock pedal through and through.\\n\\nIt may look like a DS-1, but the MD-2 really is its own beast, and I like it.  Some people may prefer the more fashionable ST-2 Power Stack, but I think the MD-2 is underappreciated, especially for bedroom/casual players who want some thickness to their tone.', \"I bought this pedal used at a local shop for about twenty bucks and it has been in heavy use ever since. I also own the Boss DS-1 and this pedal seems to have more tonal possibilities with the tone knobs. I have used the pedal with bass guitars by turning the bottom tone up and keeping some lows. It's not meant for a bass ideally and is not near as versatile as a bass fuzz pedal but sounds good.\\n\\nI bought this to have along with the DS-1 and to use with a tube amp. I have played a Les Paul, Strat and even a cigar Box guitar through it and it sounds good after a few adjustments. The gain knob can be used as an overall volume knob while keeping the amp volume level but adds some heavy high pitched distortion which may or may not be desired, but using this pedal along with the DS-1 should cover any distortion sound one may need.\", \"I bought this pedal so I don't have to travel with my really big pedalboard, and let me tell you, it does the job.\\n\\nThe distortion can get as heavy as you like with the distortion boost, also you get better harmonics the higher this setting is.\\n\\nThe low tone knob allows you to really controll how heavy u want it to sound.\\n\\nI've only run it on baterries and they really last long, the construction is really tough so you don't have to worry about stomping too hard.\\n\\nAlso gives you a nice crunchy sound if you dial all the knobs down for a mellow solo\\n\\nI really recomend this product, to have a powerfull distortion on any amp no matter how smal it is\", 'Pretty much, just like the promos say. \"IT DOES EVERYTHING THE DS-1 DOES, BETTER!\"\\n\\nThe low end is much better and tighter/crunchier.

Well I finally got to really mess with the pedal and I dialed in a really thick heavy distortion,  but not overly heavy like death metal. Just think Black Sabbath meets Godsmack.

This pedal has separate dist & gain knobs(!) U can get a slightly creamy tone with dist knob fully down & only adding some gain. Turn up the dist & suddenly its a head crusher. When used with a tube amp, this thing delivers unbelievable crunchy power. I've tried playing it into the overdrive channel of tube amps & the pedal pushes the overdriven tubes with its own colors to deliver some metal riffs which will disembowel your audience. Another plus point is that tone & bottom controls are separate. which means u can turn up the tone to be fairly bright but also add deep bass with the bottom knob.\\nDepending on the setting, your riffs are gonna sound fat(in a good way) or obese(if u turn up the knob fully). This is also useful for having a screaming metal lead tone with high freqs while also having a fat body. U can get fairly decent sound with a solid state amp but remember that this pedal sounds all out modern metal. its never going to sound like classic rock or classic marshall.\", \"This is an underrated Boss unit. It's better than the Metal Core, and great when you're going the pedal route for a heavy sound into the clean channel of an amp. There's a lot of room for tweaking so you can dial in a good sound.\\n\\nIt's inferior of course to a great heavy amp distortion from a great amp head. But, if you need to play at apartment volumes it's a great solution and doesn't cost much. It excels at heavier sounds, but I wouldn't recommend for a blues guy.\\n\\nEDIT: Also it's no substitute for an overdrive - newer guitar players make sure you're familiar with the differences...I've seen tons of kids buying one when they really want the other. Overdrives are generally used to push a tube amp for a boost or so, distortions you can use for either but has a different function. If you're playing through a cheaper solid state amp and looking for a metal sound, this is probably more for you.

Both of those are good strings and I liked them both for different reasons. However these Gibson Vintage reissue take it to another level. My guitar sounds more full bodied, and beefy. Crisp and in stays in tune better than the other strings. The nickel wound strings are better than other nickel wound strings I have used, including the ones mentioned above. Gibson has a technique that is unique to their strings. I think it makes them a better string.  They feel really good on the fingers. People say these strings last a long time and time will tell for me about that. I snapped a 1st string (E) right away when tightening it with my locking mini Grover tuners. It broke right at the tuner. But that was the tuners fault (or mine) not the string. I am going to order a couple more sets of these as I think they will be my go to string from now on. I like em.

I had visions of getting the guitar delivered, firing up the game, and learning to play something.  Boy, was I underselling this little adventure.\\n\\nI like the look of the Les Paul body, and since the closest Gibson dealer is 2 hours away, I decided to look at the local shops first.  They sold lots of Fenders (liked the Cabronita Telecaster $500) and Peavey (liked the SC2 Vintage $250).  But I didn't know the brands as well.  Since I wanted to stay under $300 and figured the Les Paul model would be a good bet for a few bucks more on Amazon, I put in my order.\\n\\nOverall, I love that Amazon got me a deal on a gorgeous guitar.  However, I am learning that with sometimes there's a reason for the deals.\\n\\nPros.\\n- The LP100 is loaded with some nice features.  I'm still learning the nuances of the tone controls.  The pick-up selector is not in the way.\\n- The Vintage Sunburst looks great.  The colors shift depending on the light - deep amber to gold.  Gorgeous with the dark fingerboard.\\n- It is a step above the $80-$100 instruments that they sell at the big box stores.  The price is right for a serious starter guitar.\\n- It arrived safely in good packaging.  No chips, knicks, or marks that I could detect.\\n- The Les Paul size is very manageable.  It just feels good to play.\\n- Stays tuned.  Initially it didn't, but when I got the fret fixed and the trussrod adjusted, it fixed that issue.\\n\\nCons\\n- No extras come with this guitar.  To set yourself up you're looking at a lot more money. (see equipment ideas below)\\n- Shipping the guitar will put it under some stress.  Expect some tuning and possible trussrod adjustments.  Epiphone recommends having a licensed guitar tech handle trussrod adjustments.  If you mess with it yourself you are at your own risk - over adjustment can seriously damage your guitar.\\n- My guitar arrived out of tune (expected).  However, even after tuning it, it wasn't playing right...G# instead of G on E-string at 3rd fret and buzzing on first 3 strings on 3rd fret.  Took it to the guitar shop that sold the Peaveys.  Two days and about $35 later, he'd fixed the trussrod AND a high fret (something I definitely wouldn't have messed with).\\n- If you order a guitar online, you really should expect to take it to a local shop where a licensed guitar tech can make sure it is set up correctly.  Be prepared for that awkward moment when he asks why you didn't buy one from him.\\n\\nEquipment Ideas (regardless of which electric guitar you start with)\\nSince the guitar is all you get, you'll probably want to buy a few extra things.  Here are some to consider as part of your start-up cost.\\n- The cheap stuff  (around $110 bucks)\\n---- Picks...$5 for an assortment\\n---- Strap...$5 for a basic nylon one\\n---- Chromatic tuner....$20-$30\\n---- Guitar stand....$15-$20\\n---- Gig bag (when traveling)...$30\\n---- Guide/Song book...$20\\n---- Ibuprofen - your fingers are gonna be sore until those calluses build up\\n\\n- The not-so-cheap stuff\\n---- Amp and cable...$150.  You don't need an amp starting out, but when you're not doing Rocksmith, you're going to want one.  You bought an electric to be LOUD, right?\\n---- Rocksmith software with cable...$60\\n---- Hard case...$100  Alternative to the gig bag after you get better and decide to start playing in front of folks.\\n---- Lessons with a pro - $15-$25 in my area of the Midwest.  Assuming 6 months of lessons - every week - $315- $525.  A pro will teach you things like proper posture, hand positions, where to hammer the fret, whether or not the pick is your friend, and whether you might be better off playing tambourine.  Committing to lessons will also likely get you to practice more - cuz you really don't want to play the tambourine, right?\\n\\nOverall\\n- If you have a Gibson dealer in your area, they may carry this very guitar, I seriously suggest visiting them and seeing if they can sell you the same thing.  They may even match Amazon's price.  If not, remember that a good dealer should provide free setup and guarantee the guitar is ready to go home.  You may be able to work out a package deal on extras if you buy everything from them.\\n- Altogether this little adventure has cost me more than I originally thought it would.  I'm glad my guitar is playing correctly now and should last me awhile.\", \"Nice Solid Guitar.  Sounds great.  I'm a beginner and this is the right tool for an entry point guitar.\", \"Great sounding guitar, looks nice too, but almost untunable and it doesn't stay in tune for long-try some bending and you'll see what I mean.
